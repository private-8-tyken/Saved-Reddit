## 🔹 Architecture & Build Process

* **Astro + React hybrid**: Astro handles static routing (`index.astro`, `[id].astro`, etc.), while React handles interactive parts (`Feed.jsx`, `PostPage.jsx`, `FilterPanel.jsx`). This is a good balance—fast static generation with dynamic client functionality.
* **Static output (`astro.config.mjs`)**: Set to `output: 'static'`, meaning everything is pre-rendered and deployable on GitHub Pages. Correct use of `site` and `base` ensures links resolve under `/Saved-Reddit/`.
* **Manifest generation (`generate-manifest.js`)**: Custom script builds `posts-manifest.json` and `facets.json` from Cloudflare R2 + local JSON. Strong design:

  * Uses AWS SDK to enumerate bucket contents.
  * Fallbacks to cached keys (`R2_SKIP_LIST`).
  * Extracts embedded images from selftext if R2 is missing.
  * Writes per-post JSON to `public/data/posts/`.
  * Also generates frequency facets (subs, authors, domains, etc.).
* **Environment variables**: Well structured, though:

  * `PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE` is empty (media URLs may break).
  * Secrets (`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are committed here—⚠️ **sensitive data should never live in `.env` checked into GitHub**.

✅ **Strength**: End-to-end indexing pipeline is solid, with good fallbacks.
⚠️ **Weakness**: Secrets exposure, and reliance on GitHub Pages with client-only authentication.

## 🔹 UI & Components

### Layout

* **BaseLayout.astro**:

  * Injects global CSS correctly (`${BASE}styles/global.css`).
  * Includes an inline auth gate (checks `sessionStorage.authed`).
  * Simple but effective.
    ⚠️ **Weakness**: Security is purely client-side obfuscation.

* **Header.astro**:

  * Floating header with branding, search, sort, favorites button, and chips for filters.
  * Chips dynamically reflect URL params.
  * Accessibility: ARIA labels and pressed states are implemented.
    ✅ Strong UX design, though a bit JS-heavy.

* **FilterPanel.jsx**:

  * Drawer-style UI with backdrop and swipe-to-open.
  * Handles facets (subs, authors, flairs, media, domains).
  * Good accessibility (`role="dialog"`, focus trap, ARIA labels).
    ⚠️ Bug: Typo `nul1l` when setting `setFacets` could break fallback.

### Feed & Posts

* **Feed.jsx**:

  * Pulls from `posts-manifest.json`.
  * Query state synced to URL (`urlchange` events).
  * Infinite scroll with IntersectionObserver.
  * Search, sort, facet filters all integrated.
    ✅ Well-structured and scalable.

* **PostCard.jsx**:

  * Shows preview info, flair, score, comments.
  * Inline expand for images/galleries/videos.
  * Tracks viewed posts in `localStorage`.
    ⚠️ Commented-out `VideoThumb` means video thumbnails fallback to a blank play icon.

* **PostPage.jsx**:

  * Fetches single post JSON + manifest entry.
  * Smart handling of image/video/gallery.
  * Auto-pause videos when scrolled out of view.
    ✅ Nice per-post UX with back button and comments.

* **CommentThread.jsx**:

  * Recursive threaded rendering with collapse/expand.
  * Works but minimal styling; could become messy with deep nesting.

* **Favorites** (`favorites.astro`):

  * CSV export/import.
  * Uses storage helpers (`storage.js`) for schema migration.
    ✅ Good persistence and interoperability.

### Utilities

* **text.js**: Clean excerpt & domain extraction helpers.
* **counts.js**: Simple reusable counting utility.
* **sorting.js**: Flexible comparators for multiple fields.
* **storage.js**【100†storage.js\*\*]:

  * Robust migration-aware favorites handling (v2 schema).
  * CSV import/export with error handling.
    ✅ One of the strongest parts of the project.

## 🔹 Styling

* **global.css**:

  * Good use of CSS variables (dark theme).
  * Responsive adjustments for header/filters.
  * Post cards have hover/active polish.
  * Skeleton shimmer implemented.
    ⚠️ Some duplication in `.post-card` styles (appears twice with slightly different definitions). Could be consolidated.

---

## 🔹 Authentication

* **Login.astro**:

  * SessionStorage-based passcode gate.
  * Entirely client-side; only obfuscates content.
    ⚠️ **Not real security**: Anyone can view content if they know the URL or disable JS. Acceptable if this is for private/personal use only.

---

## 🔹 Overall Strengths

1. **Cohesive architecture**: Data pipeline → manifest → Astro pages → React feed.
2. **Performance-minded**: Lazy loading images/videos, infinite scroll, skeletons, virtual list.
3. **Good UX**: Floating header, filter drawer, favorites management, search chips.
4. **Robust storage handling**: Migration-friendly favorites with CSV I/O.
5. **Deployable**: Fully static output for GitHub Pages.

---

## 🔹 Issues & Weaknesses

* ⚠️ **Security**: Secrets in `.env` and client-only login. Neither is safe for production.
* ⚠️ **Code hygiene**:

  * Bug in `FilterPanel.jsx` (`nul1l`).
  * Duplication in `global.css`.
  * Video thumbnails not implemented (fallback only).
* ⚠️ **Media reliability**: `PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE` is empty → media URLs may break unless set correctly.
* ⚠️ **Comments**: Nested comments could get unwieldy without styling/indent guides.

---

## 🔹 Recommendations

1. **Security**:

   * Remove `.env` from GitHub repo; load secrets via Actions or private storage.
   * Accept that login is obfuscation-only; note this clearly in README.

2. **Media handling**:

   * Ensure `PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE` is always set (maybe default to R2 worker).
   * Fix `VideoThumb` for better feed previews.

3. **Code cleanup**:

   * Fix `nul1l` typo.
   * Consolidate `.post-card` styles.
   * Audit duplicate CSS across mobile/desktop.

4. **Future enhancements**:

   * Consider real auth if you ever need privacy beyond obfuscation.
   * Paginate or lazy-load comments for large threads.
   * Add unit tests for utilities (`text.js`, `storage.js`, `sorting.js`).



# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut?** Delete this file. Have fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
