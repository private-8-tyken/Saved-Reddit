{"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"This is another post about my gangbang rape play. I have a few other plays which I always struggle to decide. I picked this, as ater this particular play, our rules changed completely.\n\n\n\nI wonder how women here get warned about your rape play.\n\nFor me, rape play is like going to see a scary movie. Would you want to know anything beyond the poster of a horror film? I don’t want to.\n\nIn our rule, my husband gives me something like prophecy, that I will be raped.  Then I spend those times not knowing when, where, or by whom it will happen.\n\nOf course, I can tell when I don't want horror movie.  For example, not during a week when I have an important presentation at work, as rapes get me injured.\n\n\n\nAt the time, I had just graduated and was about a year into my current job. At work, I’m seen as a petite, cute, married woman. I’m popular and invited to company drinking parties weekly, likely due to my personality and the odd belief among the men that it’s fine to sexually harass me. They don’t know my sexual history or all the kinky hobbies my husband and I share.\n\n\n\nWhen drunk with colleagues, I sometimes forget they’re not from our orgy parties and leave them touch my body, so that why they think I’m okay with harassment and wanting to cheat with them.\n\n\n\nThat night, my husband prophesied a gang rape after the company’s Friday drinking party.\n\nHis instruction was to wear my yellow scarf as a sign for the rapists to spot me, ensuring no other girl gets targeted by mistake.\n\nMy colleagues must never know.  This is my unbreakable rule. Yet lately, they might suspect something since I always dress sexier on scarf days. My husband also told me to wear a tight mini-skirt with no panties or bra that day.\n\n\n\nAt the company, the guy who often sexually harasses me greeted me, his eyes on my chest. I quickly covered the area with documents. He might’ve noticed. All day, I felt his gaze as he kept coming to my desk.\n\nAt the drinking party, the guy and others sat by me, pushing drinks repeatedly. At the office party, I’m always forced to overdrink. Their plan to get me drunk to drag me to a hotel is always obvious.\n\nI usually don't refuse men's orders, so I drank. I get drunk so quickly and become lustful, so I end up going along with it and drinking more. Their talk always escalates from jokes to bold sexual questions like “What sex I like” or “color of panties”.\n\nI used to resist, but by then I’ve gotten used to it. Even when they touch my ass or sneak a peek under my skirt. But that night, I can’t let them see under my skirt. What could I say? “Transparent panties”?\n\n\n\nIt got late, and they suggested going to karaoke, where harassment usually intensifies. I always half-enjoy it, but that day, overwhelmed by no panties and too much drink, I wobbled to the restroom. That guy followed, saying, “Are you okay? I’m worried…” In the dim area, he neared, complimented my yellow scarf, then grabbed my ass. “Stop it, please!” I whispered, pressing down on my skirt with my hands, but his strength was overpowering. My skirt was half pulled up, and his hand directly touched my bare ass.\n\n\n\nThen I realized. “Could it be… did my husband arrange this guy from the company to rape me?” My anger surged. This was far beyond my boundaries.\n\n“Stop it!!” I shouted, shoving him away and fleeing the bar.\n\n\n\nOn the train home, my head spun with drunkenness and fury at my husband. How could he do this? What would happen to my career? When that man touched me, the erotic tension the alcohol had me wet. Did he feel it? Did he know I wore nothing beneath? How could I face him at work the next day? My mind drowned in a haze of liquor and rage.\n\n\n\nStumbling through dark streets near my station, I hurried toward home, ready to scream at my husband. \n\nThat’s when a large van with tinted windows rolled up beside me, bass thumping loud from within. I guess you also know that kind of car.\n\n\n\nThe window slid down, music blaring, and rowdy male voices shouted, “Hey, lady! It’s dangerous walking alone like this!” I ignored them, quickening my pace, but the van sped up, screeching to a halt inches from me. “Don’t ignore us! We’re being nice enough to talk to you!” they yelled. Already burning with anger, I snapped back with curses I rarely use, my voice sharp in the quiet night.\n\nThe side door slammed open, and men reeking of alcohol and smoke poured out. Panic seized me as I fumbled for my phone to call the police, but a hard slap sent it clattering to the ground. A massive hand clamped over my mouth, and I was dragged into the van, my struggles useless against their brute force.\n\n\n\nShoved into the backseat between two men, I thrashed, biting down hard on one’s ear, the taste of blood flooding my mouth. He roared in pain, punching my stomach with a force that left me gasping, immobile with terror and agony. “This bitch! Shit, someone’s coming! Drive, now!” a voice barked as the van lurched forward, speeding to an unknown place.\n\nDuct tape sealed my mouth and eyes, my hands gripped tight by rough palms as the music roared on. The man whose ear I’d bitten seethed with rage, tearing at my blouse, buttons popping off with sharp snaps, exposing my bare chest. “Hey, look! What the hell! She’s a total slut!” another laughed, his massive hands kneading my breasts, fingers digging into my flesh. A voice from the front growled, “Come on, don’t hog her, let us have some fun too!” The injured man, still furious, slammed his fist into my stomach again, pain exploding as he forced my legs apart, his rough hands bruising my thighs.\n\n\n\n“She’s been ready for this from the start, huh? Total exhibitionist!” he sneered, noticing I wore no panties. Their laughter was a sick, wild chorus as they groped me, thick fingers shoving into my cunt without hesitation. “She’s already wet as fuck!” one crowed, and to my utter shame, it was true. My body was dripping with arousal, juices slicking my thighs in humiliating trails. This was real rape, raw and violent, the metallic tang of blood mixing with the stench of sweat and smoke. Yet, deep down, I craved this violation, my cunt clenching around their brutal fingers, wet sounds echoing with the pounding music as I fought to stifle moans through the taped gap over my mouth.\n\n\n\nWe arrived at what sounded like a large garage, echoes bouncing off unseen walls. Thrown onto cold, gasoline-reeking concrete, my skirt yanked up, upper body bare, the yellow scarf still mockingly around my neck, I was forced to kneel, ass up, legs spread wide. I screamed, struggled, but a sharp kick to my stomach and a brutal slap silenced me. Lights flicked on, dim through the tape’s edge, as impatient voices snapped, “Let’s hurry up and do this bitch!” Footsteps shuffled, “Hold on a sec!” another barks back, frustration dripping from his tone. Doors creaked, and then a sharp slap landed on my ass, again and again. Each strike made my cunt clench, wet and undeniable, a sick thrill I couldn’t deny. They noticed, mocking my drenched state with excited jeers, snapping endless pictures, the shutter sounds a relentless record of my humiliation. A belt unbuckled with a metallic clink, a large hand gripped my ass, and without warning, he thrust inside me. Bound and blind, I couldn’t resist, my voice leaking in broken, desperate moans through the tape’s gap.\n\n\n\nI’d been craving something like this all along. Even if I’d been caught by the wrong men by mistake, my body couldn’t tell the difference between real rape and play. \n\nOf course it wasn’t like my usual rape play. No body used my mouth or hands.\n\nIn the real rape, the men took turns violating me from behind. Maybe my mouth seemed too dangerous to them. My hands remained bound tightly behind my back the entire time.\n\nThe violation continued, relentless and savage, each man taking turns from behind, their weight crushing me like beasts. The first cock stretched my soaked cunt with brutal force, pushing against my inner walls, invading my deepest parts. A raw moan escaped, and he laughed mockingly, spurred by my reaction. I no longer had strength to curse them; only gasps and moans spilled out as he pistoned into me, my body trembling with shameful pleasure. The second man was bigger, stretching me to my limit, while the third was savage, grabbing my hair, shoving my face to the floor, trying my ass before hoisting my legs over his shoulders, thrusting deep in a missionary violation.\n\n\n\nTime blurred. I was fucked repeatedly, losing count.\n\nEventually, they bound my legs together, wrapped a chain around my waist, and then the men disappeared somewhere, and left me on the concrete, covered in their cum, abandoned in the cold, sticky mess of my degradation.\n\n\n\nHours slipped by, unnoticed, until the men returned. Their alcohol stench hit harder.\n\nMy throat was so dry I felt like I was dying.\n\nOne of them taunted me, asking if I wanted water. Duct tape sealed my mouth, so I groaned, nodding desperately.\n\nHe mocked me, forcing me to nod to obey anything they say, under threat of death.\n\n\n\nThey ripped the tape off my mouth, stinging my skin, and slammed a bottle to my lips. I gulped water, desperate.\n\nThen came the next order. Drink booze. A bottle forced to my mouth, the sharp, biting stench of hard alcohol hitting me. They pinched my nose, pried my mouth open. I drank, choking at the end, coughing, spilling it. Vodka, or something just as brutal, burned my stomach.\n\nI begged for a toilet, my voice wrecked from screaming in pleasure during the rape, barely came out. They laughed, “Go on, we’ll watch.”\n\n\n\nThey forced more booze, ignoring my cries. I begged, “I’ll throw up, don’t tape me.” Useless. They put tape on my mouth again, with just punched holes. Probably scared of my bite.\n\nThe entire time, blindfold stayed on. Did that mean they wouldn’t kill me? Alcohol hit hard, dizziness crashing in. Then, I was flipped over, hands tied above, exposed on my back.\n\n\n\nThis gang rape was slower, a sick entertainment as they drank and smoked, watching each other fuck me, laughing hysterically before taking turns. “Come on, you’re a sex slave now. Move your hips. If you don’t want to die, show us how much you want it,” they taunted, spewing filth as they violated me without mercy. Having climaxed countless times, I came again instantly, moving my hips as ordered, the pleasure so intense I couldn’t stop, slamming back against their thrusts. Alcohol clouded my mind, tape blocked my vision, and all I knew was the massive cocks inside me, my moans endless through the gaps, uncaring who heard. It felt so good, the dream of real rape realized, and in my broken haze, I thought I could stay their slave forever, lost in degradation and ecstasy.\n\n\n\nI don’t know how many hours had passed, but once the men were satisfied, they rolled me onto the cold concrete and disappeared somewhere. For a while, I slept. When I woke, the cold place carried the faint atmosphere of morning. Still bound and sprawled on the oil-stinking floor, I felt utterly lost. I had to escape.\n\n\n\nThen, the thought overwhelmed that I need to pee. I was desperate. Where should I let it go? I tried to get up, but with  my hands and feet tied, I could only move on all fours, and the chain on my waist didn't let me crawl more than a meter in any direction.\n\n\n\nThen the door creaked open. Duct tape ripped off my eyes, stinging as light blinded me.\n\nI saw my husband. The huge men from last night loomed around me in a large grimy auto shop.\n\nT-shirts and tight briefs clung to their muscular frames.\n\nMy husband stood among them, concern and reproach in his eyes.\n\n\n\n“Did you have fun? Biting his ear, though… too much, don’t you think?”\n\nConfusion hit hard. “Eh? Not the guy from work who was supposed to rape me?” My husband’s face twisted, baffled. “What are you talking about?”\n\n“I’m so sorry... was this the real one?” I stammered, words jumbling about the man from work I’d suspected. No one got it.\n\n\n\nWhen I blurted I thought it was strangers, not our arrangement, they roared with laughter.\n\n“You fought hard. Strong, huh,” the bandaged-ear guy said, grinning despite the injury. I apologized, guilt clawing me. “It’s fine, not serious,” he shrugged. He’d missed the first gang rape play due to bleeding, got emergency treatment. The second round was for him, alcohol dulling his pain, fueling the night’s brutality.\n\n\n\nThey untied my wrists and body. I apologized nonstop, urgently asking for the toilet.\n\nMy clothes, torn and bloodstained, were useless, so I moved through the huge car repair shop completely naked.\n\nThe men guiding me to a corner toilet, cheering and teasing.\n\n“Hey, show us how you pee! Door open!” they laughed. I declined softly but firmly.\n\nThankfully, this Saturday morning, they turned into gentlemen.\n\n\n\nIn the toilet, I relieved the pressure, then I checked myself. Blood-smeared, scraped from rough concrete. My pussy felt swollen, but that was expected. \n\nMorning sunlight revealed a sprawling auto shop, vast lot with stacked cars. Isolated, as they’d said. No one would hear screams. \n\n\n\nWe moved to the factory’s corner, an office area with old sofa amid tools and oil stains.\n\nThey grabbed cheap liquor, laughed rough and we drank. \n\nWe decided on sex again, this time, more relaxed fun and unhurried.\n\nI focused on the injured-ear guy first, guilt stinging me. Kneeling, I took his cock gently, lips soft, tongue tracing him carefully. He groaned low, hand light on my head, tension easing.\n\nUnlike last night, I pleasured them all at once. Mouth and hands busy, I sucked one deep, tongue swirling, while stroking two others, feeling them pulse.\n\n\n\nWe still get along with the four men, really well. The injured-ear guy’s my favorite.\n\nMy husband gave open permission to rape and use me anytime. We joke about “friends with rape benefits”.\n\nWe have just two rules: they have to rape me in groups and no getting caught by police.\n\nThat second one is tricky, but that’s another story.\n\n\n\nAs for the guy from the company, that’s another mess, and it has nothing to do with rape.\n\nMaybe this was too long.
