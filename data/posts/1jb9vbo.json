I really don’t know. It happened a little over a month ago and it’s still fresh so maybe that has something to do with it. Anyway, I live by myself in a two family house and a little over a month ago like I said, 4 men broke in and raped me pretty thoroughly. Feels weird to say thoroughly. What I mean by that is each of them raped me a number of times and I think stayed there for a few hours until they were finished. I’ll get into it more below, but I did orgasm for them - a number of times - and I’m struggling with the fact that I liked it I think. It doesn’t make sense to me that I could have felt and acted the way I did and have it not be consensual.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I said above, I live on the ground floor of a two-family house and the upstairs is currently uninhabited, and I was asleep when they broke in. I didn’t hear anything and I wasn’t woken up until one of them was pulling the covers off me and pulling me out of bed and down the hallway to the living room. I had on a pale green pair of satin pajamas with a matching top and bottom. The top was a button up and the bottoms were shorts. I was not wearing a bra or underwear. Getting woken up like that was shocking, to say the least, and it took me a few seconds to even realize what was even happening. By the time I did I was halfway down the hallway and when I started to resist him pulling me, he picked me up and carried me the rest of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was terrified to say the least, and I was begging them to leave and let me go and that I wouldn’t tell anyone but they weren’t really listening or acknowledging me. I could see all their faces and being totally honest I thought they were going to kill me or kidnap me or something. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I really remember is one of them asking me what they were going to do with me. I was crying and begging them to just leave and that I wouldn’t tell, but he didn’t seem to care about that and said maybe they would but he wasn’t sure yet and that it was up to me. I was so panicked I didn’t really register what he was saying until the man that had carried me out there put and arm around my torso and kind of started playing with one of the buttons on my top and said he had an idea of something we could do before they left. I feel like I should have struggled more or tried to run but I was petrified. It’s hard to explain really. He was telling me that they’d happily be on their way and wouldn’t even take anything but I had to make it worth their while, and as he was saying that he started unbuttoning the buttons until my breasts were visible. Again, I know I should have fought back or done anything but I was terrified and felt like I couldn’t even move.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn’t take my top off, but just let it hang open, and he asked me if I had any ideas. I couldn’t really respond and just shook my head. One of the others said he thought that if I got down on my knees that would probably work, and he asked the other three if they thought that would be good and they all said they thought it would be. I didn’t really move and just kind of stood there, and one of them asked me what the matter was and if I’d prefer the alternative. I shook my head again and he said “Well…” and one of the others said it wouldn’t be bad because I probably did stuff like that all the time and the rest of them laughed. They were all expectantly looking at me and I guess I was scared that I just did.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of them said good girl and another walked up to me so he was standing in front of me. I pleaded with him again saying I wouldn’t tell anyone and that I had a boyfriend and to please just leave, and he said that was all fine if I wanted to get hurt, and asked if I wanted that. I guess I didn’t even answer and just started unbuttoning and unzipping his jeans which felt so slutty. I could see him straining against his jeans and even more so against his boxers, and when I took his penis out he was fully erect and extremely hard. When I took him into my mouth I remember being aware of how warm it was. He moaned softly as I did and called me a good girl, and started running his hand through my hair.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe kind of just let me go for a while, alternating between calling me a slut and some variation of a good girl. The rest of them got involved too and I’d alternate between them periodically. A little while after I started one of them took my top all the way off too so I just had my shorts on. I guess I lost track of time, but it felt like it had been going for a while, and I had been giving one of them head for longer than the others and he was really moaning. I could feel his penis twitching a little and then suddenly he moaned he was going to cum and pulled out of my mouth and shot it all over my face. The other three laughed and said I looked good that way, and one of them threw a towel at me to wipe it off because he didn’t want to get any on him.\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess I thought there would be more after that, but one of them said how about we take this back to the bedroom and the others agreed. I wanted to protest but I was picked up again and even though I was crying and telling them to stop they totally ignored me. For reference, I’m 5’3” and barely 100lbs and they were easily like 6’5” or something.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was thrown on my bed on my back and my shorts were pulled off and I could feel one of them lining up outside of me. He kind of moved the tip around a little before pushing in and I guess I was surprised that I was wet enough for it to not hurt. He moaned as he did, and told me I had a tight pussy, but I just kind of laid there looking up at the ceiling as he thrusted in and out of me. I was trying not to think about it and I was able to zone out for a little bit I guess but as it continued it was harder and harder and it got to the point where I felt like I was going to orgasm. I really didn’t want to and tried to fight it as hard as I could but there was nothing I could do. I guess he could tell because shortly before it happened he was telling me to cum for him and even though I didn’t want to I couldn’t help it and I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was pretty strong and I did moan during it a little in addition to unconsciously bringing a hand up to hold one of my breasts. He continued thrusting through my orgasm and when it started subsiding he and one of the others said they knew I was into it and was just now getting out of my shell. When it had fully subsided he pulled out of me and told me to flip over, which I did, into doggy and he switched positions with one of the others so he was in front and another penetrated me and they spit roasted me. Shortly after, he was moaning he was going to cum again but told me to keep going and he came in my mouth. He told me to show him and then swallow, which I did.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey continued doing that for what felt like forever. When I was put into cowgirl, I rode them of my own accord and felt like whore while doing it. They originally would pull out of me and cum on my face or on my stomach, but towards the end a few did cum inside of me. They had me in basically every positon I could think of and I did cum for them a number of times more. I don’t exactly know when, but I think I did become a participant, and was even moaning a little bit during it. It just turned me into a total whore somehow. \n\n\n\n\n\nBefore this happened I had always been pretty modest but this just turned me into a fucking slut. When they left, they just left me lying in my bed with cum all over me and a big fucking mess. I don’t think they took anything, so I guess they were true to their word with that, but I’m never going to forget what they did to me, obviously. What I said about having a boyfriend is true, and we are currently long distance which started a few months before this happened. I’m 22 and he’s 24 and we’ve been dating for about 3 years. I feel so bad about how he was probably sleeping and not even considering that I was being a slut for 4 men. I haven’t told him yet and don’t know if I will. Even worse, I’m on here writing about it knowing guys are going to have their penises in their hands reading it. It’s so fucked.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have masturbated to this a few times which freaked me out, and I have been considering therapy. I do not want to break up with my boyfriend so I don’t think CNC is an option from what I’ve read about it. I know that I cheated and that I need to tell him, but I just don’t know how I’m going to do that or what his reaction would be. I believe he’d support me, but he’d also never be able to look at me the same again knowing what happened.

I think you're confusing several different issues and that's why it all feel so complicated. \n\n\nWhat they did was absolutely the most stereotypical definition of rape. Even if you had orgasms, even if you had a great time and want them to do it again and call them back. Breaking into somebody's house and fucking them when they have begged you to stop under the threat of force is like the textbook definition hard stop. Your reaction doesn't change that. And it doesn't make you responsible for their actions. If you get kidnapped by a chef who's a great cook and find out you enjoy a vegetable you've never heard of it's still kidnapping. Same thing. \n\n\nYou may or may not be a slut, but even if you are a slut, and I don't think you are, it was still right. The two are unrelated. And specially somebody who doesn't sound like they've done anything else bloody besides have The misfortune to have these assholes show up doesn't seem slutty. But if you want to go be slutty that's mostly your business. \n\n\nYou didn't cheat on your boyfriend just because you had orgasms. same as if someone kidnapped you and that made you miss a lot of work, it doesn't make you a bad employee. \n\n\nI'm not trying to put words into your mouth or ideas in your head, it kind of sounds like you want to fuck people CNC style. Maybe people besides your boyfriend? At the same time it seems like you don't want to cheat on him. And again, nothing wrong with wanting something here. Even if you decide that's something you're going to do, it doesn't make you bad, it doesn't mean it wasn't rape. Even if you decided that you specifically were going to try to do it again with the specific guys it doesn't make the first time not ready. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR DON'T TRY IT AGAIN WITH THE SAME SPECIFIC GUYS EVEN IF THE CHANCE PRESENTS ITSELF. PLEASE. THESE DUDES SOUND LIKE PSYCHOS OF THE WORST KIND. \n\n\n and honestly I wouldn't encourage you to cheat, at the same time if you've got a long distance boyfriend and the worst you do is a little pink play after becoming a rape victim then you know don't beat yourself up too hard about that. I would just assume any girl I was long-distance with was going to occasionally get fucked by someone else, and anybody who doesn't assume that is just being silly and again, just to be utterly clear because someone's going to try and pretend I said something else because it's the internet, if you can hold it together well enough to not cheat on him that's great, and this isn't an excuse or get out of jail free card. But on the scale of evil you got to remember it's probably a lot closer to hungry man stealing bread than it is vicious evil girlfriend deliberately hurts boyfriend. Which again just to be clear, because it's the internet, it's not ideal, it's not good, and if you can stay sane while avoiding it avoid it. \n\n\nMaybe look at some professional help if pragmatic. I don't know your country or your details or anything like that so not sure exactly what's available. Bare minimum there are online support groups. But if you just want to read a bunch of kinky stories and goon to it that's okay too, don't beat yourself up because you're not ready for therapy.","score":92,"created_utc":1741975932,"permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/1jb9vbo/they_made_me_a_slut/mhseas8/","is_submitter":false,"parent_id":"t3_1jb9vbo","replies":[{"id":"mhsfbfs","author":"[deleted]","author_fullname":null,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write all of that.

The way you feel is pretty obviously conflicted. \n\n\nYou found out some things that your whole life you assumed you hated or didn't even think about can under some circumstances be very enjoyable. \n\n\nAnd at some level for your whole life people have told you that if you enjoy something you're somehow responsible for it. Which obviously isn't true, someone might enjoy recessions but they don't have the power to create one.
