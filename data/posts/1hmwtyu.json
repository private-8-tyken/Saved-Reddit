{"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"This wasn’t my first experience, but is my most recent… I’m sharing on here for the first time, and I’m not sure what I’m looking for out of it. I’m female, engaged, 24 years old, this happened a little over a month ago. \n\nI went to a frat party with a girlfriend who was looking to meet up with a guy she was interested in. She brought me along so as not to be alone and to maybe cockblock if things got weird. \n\nI wasn’t baiting, at least not consciously. I felt like I had dealt with my past trauma as well as could be expected and had been managing well for almost a year. I was, and still am, happily engaged to a great guy. All that said, I knew the setting might stir up some emotions. I had been to the house before, a few years back, and they weren’t known to be out of control as far as partying. I admit I was curious as to how I would handle the atmosphere emotionally. \n\nI wore tight jeans, boots, a button up blouse, my hair pulled back in a ponytail, and my engagement ring. My girl friend and I had a beer and soon her and the guy she was interested in were chatting away in a corner. I was scrolling my phone for an uber when  “Terry” approached, asking why I was leaving already, etc… He was older than me, late 20’s, not a frat member but a tag a long like myself. He was tall, well built, athletic, and kind of rough looking for a college party.  Not great looking, but he wouldn’t have trouble finding company at that party, especially after the alcohol kicked in. \n\nI was polite… he was polite… he noticed my ring… I told him I was here with a friend but about to leave. He insisted on one more beer, and jokingly suggested we share the uber, since he was also feeling out of place. I agreed to have a beer, since the uber was going to be a while. I made a point of getting the beer myself and he commented that was smart of me. That second beer turned into a third beer and I admit that a one night stand crossed my mind. Not in a serious way, but just in a “last fling before marriage” dark romance way. I mean it just fit the scene, but I was definitely not interested in going down that path. \n\nI had to pee and told Terry, I was going to the restroom, then head out. It was a nice way to ditch each other without getting too awkward. I told him I was familiar with the house and could find the bathroom myself. Terry said, OK, he told me to take care etc.. we hadn’t hung out more than an hour. \n\nIn the rest room, I felt a light buzz, definitely not drunk, but warm. When I was fixing myself in the mirror, I actually felt good that I had handled the emotions. \n\nComing out of the bathroom, of course, Terry was waiting.. he grabbed my upper arm firmly.. “oh you took forever”, he said playfully. He walked me past a line of drunk 19 and 20 year olds, all staring at their phones, waiting to use the toilet. Terry yanked my arm and we stumbled down a hallway, away from the main party, “let’s find your friend”, he said laughing. \n\nHe opened a door and pulled me into what seemed like a storage room… “what the fuck”, I yelled and he slammed me back against the door. \n\n“please.. no… no… no…” , I said, not yelling, but pretty loud in that smaller space. He slapped my stomach with his hand, knocking the air out of me. I gasped, struggling to breathe, unable to scream, protest, or beg. He yanked my blouse open, buttons flying, then yanked my bra down, my 34c tits flopping out. \n\nStrange, but my first thought was the blouse was ruined, how would I explain that. I didn’t think about it long as he was quickly on me, pressing me against the closed door, mauling my tits with his rough hands and devouring my neck with his mouth. \n\n“Please no, stop”, I gasped, my voice dry, cracking. He couldn’t have known it, but my shoulders, neck, ears are extremely sensitive and turns me on like nothing else. My nipples stiffened despite the rough treatment, and I felt the warmth rushing between my legs. \n\n“You’re just a cheating little slut”, he growled in my ear, as his hands moved from my tits to my jeans, unbuttoning them. I tried to push him away, useless.. then to block his hands.. also useless. He managed to yank my jeans and panties down to my knees. \n\nShoving his big paw between my legs hurt almost as much as getting hit in the stomach. His hand slammed against my lips, my clit, as he roughly pushed two fingers into my wetness. \n\n“Mmmmm, fuck yeah”, he grunted, then used his fingers to smear my own juices on my face and pushed his fingers in my mouth. He pushed me to my knees and then opened his own pants, his cock sprang free and he slapped it against my face a few times… my utter defeat was becoming obvious… \n\n“please don’t do this”, I whimpered. \n\nHe pushed me over, onto my back, and finished yanking my jeans off, dragging me along the floor in the process. Then he rolled me back over face down, ass up, my face pressed against some sort of laundry bag. My cunt was wet, my body mostly limp, as he lined himself up and started forcefully pushing himself into me. \n\nHe was big, but my wet slit didn’t offer much resistance as he buried himself in me. I groaned into the laundry bag, he was stretching me very roughly and the violation… again… why?\n\nHe slapped my ass and hips a few times. “Ohhh, damn… you feel good baby… you’re man ain’t enough is he”, he taunted me as he worked up a rhythm. He lasted forever, occasionally mashing his fat head into my cervix, causing me to groan into pain, before I returned to moaning.. humiliated. \n\nI felt the pressure building, an inevitable, humiliating orgasm. I felt my cunt involuntarily squeezing his shaft, as it built. He noticed too.\n\n“Oh … bitch are you gonna cum for me? You’re too good to be true”, he continued to taunt. \n\nOf course, I did cum on his cock, moaning, gasping, softly crying… my legs shaking, and quivering… there was no doubt. \n\nThen I felt his cock swell and pulse and he unloaded in me. Blast after blast of hot cum, my battered cunt and cervix welcoming it. \n\nHe rolled me onto my back and sat on my shoulders. His fat, wet cock across my face. If he said anything I didn’t hear or understand. He forced my mouth open and his cock inside. My lips sealed him in and I cleaned the mixture of our juices off his softening cock. I didn’t care, I wasn’t trying to please him, I just wanted him to stop making me do stuff, manhandling me. \n\n“You’re not going to tell anyone”, he said. It wasn’t a question or threat, just a fact. \n\nHe took my phone and put his number in it, “Keep in touch”, he said cruelly. \n\nHe got dressed and left me there to put myself back together.
