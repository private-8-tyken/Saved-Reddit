The MFF threesome was fun for both of us.\nAnd then I reminded him that now we would also have a MMF threesome.\nMy bf has a very big penis (≈7.5 inches/18cm) and an even bigger ego. He is convinced he is a sex god. Honestly, though, he's pretty average in bed and I think he just relies on his penis size and believes that because of that he's automatically a sex god. I like his big dick and sex with him is fun but i had much better sex with other guys...\n\nI then found a guy for the threesome and my bf also agreed. I had a lot of fun with two guys. We had a very long foreplay and I also vibed very well with the other guy. I felt like he was creative in bed and just knew how to touch me (more than my bf haha). Then we started fucking. The other guy went first and fucked me doggystyle while I gave my bf a blowjob. While the guy fucked me he touched me with his hand on my clit. And it was just fantastic. He just knew how to touch me and just had a rhythm with his hand and his penis. It just got more and more intense. To be honest the sex was much much better than it ever was with my bf. And I felt like it was already bothering my bf then how much I was enjoying it. And then I had a really super intense orgasm and I was really loud during it. With my bf I almost never have orgasms....\nThe guy comtinued fucking me and then he did something which is kind of really mean. He grabbed my neck and pushed my head super hard on the bed so I couldn't blow my bf' s dick anymore. I found this move really mean and to be honest that's exactly what made me extremely horny.\n\nHe fucked me extremely hard for a few more minutes. He beat me, scratched me, etc. It was just amazing. Maybe the best sex i ever had. my bf we have more or less ignored and he sat there and jerked. I found this guy's dominance just so attractive!\nAfter that it was my bf's turn. But he had problems to get an erection.\nAfter like 5 minutes, the other guy fucked me again.\n\nI had the feeling my bf was totally pissed, but he acted as if everything was cool. Somehow I have the feeling his view that he is the sex god is destroyed. Overall, the sex was incredibly good and I would incredibly like to sleep with the guy again.\n\nAnd I know it sounds wrong: But somehow it totally excited me that my bf was humiliated. I did not know that I am so sadistic.\nAnd on my body there are scratches and bruises everywhere from this sex and the thinking about my boyfriend sees this makes me horny.",

Bigger. I imagine her face as she's getting plowed and stretched struggling to keep my cock in her mouth, her teeth lightly clenching around me trying to hold on as his thrusts push her back and forth on me.\n\nIt would turn me on so much to see her being pleasured this way and struggling to keep it together as I keep her head pressed down into my crotch, fingers gripped in her hair and my length down her throat getting railed to orgasm.\n\nHowever I do make my girl orgasm, internal and external, alot. Sometimes I just let them flow, upto 10 times a session, others I edge her and only let her have a few. Quite often as she reaches the end of an orgasm (internal) I switch up the angle, speed and/or depth and just as she tries to catch her breath smash the next one out, damn at this point she's a quivering mess just trying to breathe. No mercy. Even when I know she's all done, struggling to stay conscious, I still gotta blow. Smashing her harder and faster she gives up trying to breath as her eyes roll back, a feeling or pure extasy I spread my fingers through her hair and lift the weight of her head turning it to see her face as she's all fucked up before forcing her back down to the bed as I finish with some real hard and deap blows to drain my sack. When finished using her I push her onto her side and watch as she comes around, taking a huge breath while choking feeling completely used and helpless, cum pouring out of her glowing sore pussy. \n\nYou need to work through it with him, talk about what happened and how he felt and how it turned you on, if he wants to try again ect, just don't get hooked on 1 other guy because it was better. Maybe flip the cards and have him go to town on somebody while your forced to watch with hands tied. Maybe tell him what to do to her. \n\nThe fact he thought he was better than he is and he doesn't make you orgasm probably just killed the mood for him so when you stopped, he flopped. But I guess hes still kinda young and sounds very inexperienced. Practice makes perfect and communication is key. Break it to him gently that he needs to work on stuff. Tell him what you want him to do and show him how to do it.\n\nNobody should feel like they are a sex god, there's always somebody that can do better, or even just do things differently. He needs to learn that he needs to... Learn. Guide him and use the experience to enhance him. If your relationship is serious and you have the desire to make that last but also lust for so much more you need to tackle that early on, trust me.",

Porn makes a big cock seem like a ticket to endless pussy, but if you rely on the size and don't know how to pleasure a woman, what's the point?\n\nIt's an acquired skill to know how to touch a clit. How to control your strokes, how to eat a pussy, how to touch a woman's erogenous zones and get her excited. Sex isn't just touch, it's feeling. If she's not into it, you might cum, but she isn't going to call you back for seconds.\n\nSo many guys will just aggressively touch and rub the clit like they're removing a stain from a white sheet. But you need to slowly work your way there. If she isn't stimulated and excited, it's not going to feel like much for her when you rub her clit.\n\nSo many guys don't even realise that a lot of women won't even cum from PIV. They need foreplay and lots of it. A lot of guys are just selfish and brainwashed from porn. I've been with girls that claim they've never had an orgasm from PIV and in most cases, it's just because they've been with lazy guys.\n\nHopefully your boyfriend has learned a very valuable lesson.",

If she&amp;#39;s not into it, you might cum, but she isn&amp;#39;t going to call you back for seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many guys will just aggressively touch and rub the clit like they&amp;#39;re removing a stain from a white sheet. But you need to slowly work your way there. If she isn&amp;#39;t stimulated and excited, it&amp;#39;s not going to feel like much for her when you rub her clit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So many guys don&amp;#39;t even realise that a lot of women won&amp;#39;t even cum from PIV. They need foreplay and lots of it. A lot of guys are just selfish and brainwashed from porn. I&amp;#39;ve been with girls that claim they&amp;#39;ve never had an orgasm from PIV and in most cases, it&amp;#39;s just because they&amp;#39;ve been with lazy guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully your boyfriend has learned a very valuable lesson.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Do not be “that woman.” Someone who cheats on her man cuz this other person is better in bed, or because you crave his dominance.

I’m just saying for posterity sake. \nNow if your relationship with your current boyfriend is good in all other areas generally speaking, then I would suggest speeding some intimate time with him and having a very calm but serious talk about your sex life. And help him understand your needs and desires better so he can become the kind of man in bed that you want him to be for you. All too often one side or the other in a relationship just gives up without even really trying to help their partner meet their maximum potential let alone work with them to help their partner simply meet their needs. Your current boyfriend is 100% capable of being the kind of man you want him to be in bed for you as long as he has the desire and drive to learn and meet that expectation. He’s already got a big dick apparently so he’s got that going for him now he just needs to learn how to really use it and more to the best of his ability.",

Maybe there are things to do that you both never tried before and would be something only your bf gets to do with you?\n\nIt's easier for a guy who doesn't know you to be rough and degrading and dominating because he has nothing invested in the relationship and nothing to gain or lose. But people in relationships need to explore sex by talking about it and helping eachother. You have to be willing to come out of your comfort zones a little, and push your partners boundaries (as it seems you did by going all out in your MFM as you did).\n\nAnd also its not always about sex to help boost his confidence which sometimes you need to do for him. Touching his arm or chest, fingers through his hair, hugging, standing or sitting close to and brushing up to him. Things my wife does that I notice and make me feel like she is mine. Sounds like he needs a little confidence boost after what he experienced. \n\nHe also has to care and try. I've been on reddit almost daily for 3 months trying to figure out how to increase and improve sex life with my wife. But it's critical to a lasting relationship. Good luck.",

Bigger. I imagine her face as she's getting plowed and stretched struggling to keep my cock in her mouth, her teeth lightly clenching around me trying to hold on as his thrusts push her back and forth on me.\n\nIt would turn me on so much to see her being pleasured this way and struggling to keep it together as I keep her head pressed down into my crotch, fingers gripped in her hair and my length down her throat getting railed to orgasm.\n\nHowever I do make my girl orgasm, internal and external, alot. Sometimes I just let them flow, upto 10 times a session, others I edge her and only let her have a few. Quite often as she reaches the end of an orgasm (internal) I switch up the angle, speed and/or depth and just as she tries to catch her breath smash the next one out, damn at this point she's a quivering mess just trying to breathe. No mercy. Even when I know she's all done, struggling to stay conscious, I still gotta blow. Smashing her harder and faster she gives up trying to breath as her eyes roll back, a feeling or pure extasy I spread my fingers through her hair and lift the weight of her head turning it to see her face as she's all fucked up before forcing her back down to the bed as I finish with some real hard and deap blows to drain my sack. When finished using her I push her onto her side and watch as she comes around, taking a huge breath while choking feeling completely used and helpless, cum pouring out of her glowing sore pussy. \n\nYou need to work through it with him, talk about what happened and how he felt and how it turned you on, if he wants to try again ect, just don't get hooked on 1 other guy because it was better. Maybe flip the cards and have him go to town on somebody while your forced to watch with hands tied. Maybe tell him what to do to her. \n\nThe fact he thought he was better than he is and he doesn't make you orgasm probably just killed the mood for him so when you stopped, he flopped. But I guess hes still kinda young and sounds very inexperienced. Practice makes perfect and communication is key. Break it to him gently that he needs to work on stuff. Tell him what you want him to do and show him how to do it.\n\nNobody should feel like they are a sex god, there's always somebody that can do better, or even just do things differently. He needs to learn that he needs to... Learn. Guide him and use the experience to enhance him. If your relationship is serious and you have the desire to make that last but also lust for so much more you need to tackle that early on, trust me.",

Do not be “that woman.” Someone who cheats on her man cuz this other person is better in bed, or because you crave his dominance. By all means peruse something, anything else with him as you please, but END your current relationship first as your current bf does not deserve the hurt and brokenness he will feel if/when he ever finds out if you choose you cheat. I’m just saying, don’t think it’s ok or a good idea to get the best of both worlds here without consequences. \n\nI’m not trying to point fingers or level accusations, and I’m not saying that you “were going to”, or would do this. I’m just saying for posterity sake. \nNow if your relationship with your current boyfriend is good in all other areas generally speaking, then I would suggest speeding some intimate time with him and having a very calm but serious talk about your sex life. And help him understand your needs and desires better so he can become the kind of man in bed that you want him to be for you. All too often one side or the other in a relationship just gives up without even really trying to help their partner meet their maximum potential let alone work with them to help their partner simply meet their needs. Your current boyfriend is 100% capable of being the kind of man you want him to be in bed for you as long as he has the desire and drive to learn and meet that expectation. He’s already got a big dick apparently so he’s got that going for him now he just needs to learn how to really use it and more to the best of his ability.",
