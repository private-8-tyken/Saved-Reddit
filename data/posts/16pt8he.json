At the time, not only was it a great financial decision, it sounded pretty hot, so I agreed.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of this year. I move in with my boyfriend and two of his friends, neither of whom I'd met before. They're all taller than me, and all three of them bodybuild, so picture this petite 5'4\" blonde showing up in a crop top and short shorts and saying hi to three people who could snap me in half like a twig.\n\nAt first, it was great! It was a bit annoying when my bf would tell me to make him cum while I was in the middle of a ranked game, but overall? It worked out.\n\nThen, his friends started getting handsy. It was just comments at first, weird ones—stuff like \"your tits look great today\" or \"wow, I wish you weren't taken.\" Then, soon after, they started touching me. I thought it was accidental at the time, so I brushed it off, but I'd be cooking and one of them would \"accidentally\" trip and get a grip of my ass, or he'd take a selfie with me and find his hands wandering.\n\nThey got bolder and bolder until I knew 100% that they were trying to feel me up, so I talked to my bf about it and he promised he'd have a chat with them. Then, for a while, it was fine. They didn't touch me, they didn't say weird shit to me, and all was normal.\n\nAnd then, one night, I fell asleep watching a movie on the couch and woke up with cum painting my top. Way too much cum for it to have been one person.\n\nObviously, I went screaming to my boyfriend, because while I would've been okay (disgusted, maybe, but turned on too) with him doing it, it was NOT OKAY for someone else to jerk off on me. Absolutely not.\n\nInstead of saying he'd talk to them, though, he slapped me, grabbed me by the throat, and told me that it was \"about damn time I proved what I was worth.\"\n\nHe fucked me right then and there, completely raw, and I didn't resist even though it hurt like hell. I cried a little, but that was what I agreed to.\n\nWhat I didn't agree to was his friends using me too. He didn't let me take my top off, saying that a good slut like me should be proud of it, and then, like they'd been waiting for this, his friends came out into the living room and I was too scared of them to resist.\n\nThey tore the rest of my clothes off and fucked me for what felt like hours. They took turns. One guy in my mouth, one in my cunt. I couldn't stop crying.\n\nMy boyfriend came inside me. One of his friends came in my mouth, then had me spit the cum out onto the hardwood floor. The other one came on my tits.\n\nIt didn't stop there. They told me to clean up after myself, and they watched and RECORDED me as they forced me to:\n\na) Lick the cum off the floor\n\nb) Wipe the cum off my tits and swallow it\n\nand, most embarrassingly:\n\nc) Dig my boyfriend's cum out of my pussy and drink that too.\n\nHe threatened me by saying he'd show everyone at school what a fucking slut I was, and that there was no way to prove he'd done anything. He threatened to kick me out of the apartment if I didn't stay quiet and follow his orders.\n\nThat day wasn't the last of it. Not by a long shot.\n\nI've learned now to not wear clothes while in the apartment. As soon as I get back from class or an outing with my friends, I strip down and put everything away so they don't ruin those clothes too. They fuck me whenever they want, and even though I never stop trying to resist, they're so much stronger than me.\n\nCum, cum, cum. It feels like that's all my life is these days. I can't count how many times they've made me cum. I can't how many times they've ejaculated inside me or on me or on the floor or in my food. The worst is when it gets in my hair. God, that's so hard to clean.\n\nThey rape me when I sleep. They rape me when I cook. They rape me when I'm trying to study. They rape me, they rape me, they rape me.\n\nI think I'm starting to enjoy it. I'm scared of what that means for me.","author":"involuntaryslut","author_fullname":"t2_ka78cs9qj","subreddit":"Rapekink","subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","created_utc":1695437828,"is_self":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/16pt8he/raped_for_my_share_of_rent/","domain":"self.Rapekink","post_hint":null,"is_gallery":false,"over_18":true,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":"unwanted rape","is_original_content":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"num_comments":18,"score":766,"upvote_ratio":1,"media":null,"external_link":null,"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"Bit of background—I'm a 20F college student, broke beyond belief, barely surviving even with financial aid.\n\nLast summer, my boyfriend offered to let me move in with his buddies this year—and I wouldn't have to pay rent, just as long as I sucked him off or let him fuck me whenever he asked.

You can just say \"things aren't safe in the apartment right now.\" And if people press you further when you aren't ready to talk, firmly say \"that's all I can say right now.\" But don't make something up to reassure them like that you and your boyfriend just broke up. Do not say things to yourself or others that undermines the serious nature of the crimes that these men are committing against you. Just say you can not talk about it if you don't feel comfortable.

But you do what ever you need to do to be able to live your life in an environment where you are not being harassed, even if that means leaving school.\n•long term support and healing.

A well educated therapist will understand the complicated ways that you feel- these feelings are natural ways a person body and mind may cope with being in an extreme situation of abuse like what you are in.\n\nYou could text with your boyfriend to try to get him to incriminate himself.
