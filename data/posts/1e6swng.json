{"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"When I was 20 I decided to throw a Halloween party. My parents were out of town (cliche, but true,) and Halloween was my favorite holiday! I decorated my house as spooky as I could afford, bought a lot of alcohol to make a big batch of “jungle juice,” and invited all (not many) of my friends over.\n\nI was single at the time and had asked my friend if her boyfriend had a friend that he could invite who would want to kiss me a little bit. I was dressed up like Velma and this guy said he was going to dress like Shaggy (he didn’t 👎🏻).  I had been texting this guy the day prior and all he responded with were 1 word messages. I wasn’t excited to meet him from the texts we had, but I thought it would be rude to uninvite him and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was a better conversationalist in person (he wasn’t 👎🏻).\n\nAt that point in my life I was always drinking to get absolutely shit faced. By the time this man, let’s call him Fred, got to my house I was already decently drunk. I remember thinking that Fred was very dull in person. The type of person that makes you think, maybe other people *are* just NPCs. But he was an NPC my drunk ass could kiss so I didn’t have much of a complaint then.\n\nI was partying, playing beer pong, and kissing Fred. I really like kissing. I think it’s why I end up in so many situations like this. Because I kiss voraciously and insistently and passionately, and I think other people look into it a lot more than just me wanting to kiss. At one point when we were making out Fred took my hand down and placed it on his erection. I brought my hand back up and kissed a bit more. (Fred was a bad kisser too 👎🏻) He asked me if I wanted to go up to my room and I told him “No. It would be bad for a hostess to leave her own party.” We played beer pong and drank some more. We kissed occasionally. Talked to him, talked to my friends. I made food and forgot to eat any of it, just serving it to my guests.\n\nFred and I kept making out here and there. Almost every time he led my hand down to his erection. As I was more drunk, I was feeling him up a bit. He grabbed my boobs over my turtleneck and was playing with them. He told me he had always had a crush on Velma- I told him a lot of people do. He asked me a loooot if I would go up to my room with him. I kept telling him “No, because x y z.”\n\nHere’s where I fucked up- I grabbed a red solo cup full of what I thought was my half-water half-jungle juice and *chugged* it. It was not my jungle juice. It was a whole cup of Fireball.\n\nI was fine at that point and we all kept partying. Passing around a joint, dancing, and drinking. I don’t know what the last thing I remember is. I know I had to keep going pee. I took my wig off because it was getting hot. Dancing.\n\nI was mostly blacked out at that point. I remember throwing up in the bathtub. Whenever I get really drunk and have to throw up I piss my pants while I’m throwing up. I remember my friend helping me up the stairs and putting a trash can by my bed.\n\nI remember Fred getting into bed with me. I remember him rutting into me. I don’t know when I got naked. I think Fred undressed me. He kept the knee socks on me though. He told me he had to cum and I remember telling him to cum in me. He asked if I was on birth control and I said “Yes.” I wasn’t on birth control…. I feel such a disconnect from myself remembering that moment. I lost hours that night. I was saying “No” all night, and then I have to remember myself saying “Yes.” I don’t know why I lied to Fred. I was barely even conscious in that moment. I could feel I had not showered since pissing myself and I remember the feeling of this man cumming inside of me as I’m still covered in my own piss.\n\nI remember Fred cumming in me the first time. And the second. And the third. I remember him rolling over in my bed to go to sleep. I remember drifting off to sleep, still covered in piss and now sweat as creampies I barely even realized were happening were dripping out of me.\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning Fred was gone, leaving sometime before I woke up. I didn’t throw up at all in the night, evident by my empty trash can. I remember waking up, and feeling the cum in me. Shocked for a second until I remembered the event of the previous night- remembered telling Fred to cum in me. I got up and took a shower.\n\nMy friends were telling me stories about how drunk I was. They said when I went to the bathroom once I came out and my skirt was accidentally tucked into my thong, accidentally showing my ass to everyone. They said Fred enjoyed the view. They also said that I was making out viciously with Fred in front of them. Feeling him up while they could see.\n\nI know that doesn’t mean I asked for it but it makes it harder for me to move on from it. I also don’t know how drunk Fred was. Definitely not nearly as drunk as I was. I also wonder though if I stopped saying “No” as I got more drunk. I also think though if I had stopped saying “no” then we would have been in my bedroom before I threw up everywhere. (My friends also told me, before throwing up in the bathtub, I started puking while we were having a smoke circle outside.)\n\nSorry for such a long post I just really needed to share that and I guess I remember more than I thought I did.","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"One drunk Halloween night…","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Rapekink","hidden":false,"pwls":null,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_1e6swng","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.99,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":212,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"author_fullname":"t2_ocnw5tjr","secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"unwanted rape","can_mod_post":false,"score":212,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1721355931,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.Rapekink","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>When I was 20 I decided to throw a Halloween party.
