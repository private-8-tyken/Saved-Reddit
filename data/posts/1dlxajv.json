{"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"I (21m) had an experience back in 2021 spanning across 4 months (September through till December) where I was heavily coerced and manipulated and I still haven't really gotten over it yet. It's hard for me to talk about because I can't really say I was raped, so I'm hesitant to post here since it doesn't feel valid enough.\n\nSo basically, when I moved to the states to start college this girl from my classes latched onto me. Later her friends described it to me as \"you were *shiny*\".   \nThe whole way through right from the very first week I met her I was confused out of my mind. Eventually in December when I began to actually start to put things together properly she cut ties with me completely. I spent the rest of December and then some just processing what I had experienced.\n\nIf you want to know more about this confusing time in my life and about how she slowly eroded my boundaries eventually managing to get away with what amounted to me practically being her temporary boyfriend whilst keeping me unaware and convincing me we were just *intimate* friends thus requiring zero commitment/emotional investment from her... then lmk in the comments and I'll elaborate.   \n^((My non standard social awareness and zero dating experience at that point made me easy to exploit, tho there's more to it than just that.))  \nSince this is r/rapekink tho, I'll focus on the sex.\n\nEarly on after I made it clear I wasn't going to date her she brought up *friends with benefits* and I said I was okay with kissing/cuddling and light intimacy but I drew the line at sex. So it started with just kissing/cuddling but then she wanted me to take my clothes off more or wanted to give me a blowjob and things got more intimate over time but I held firm on no penetrative sex. But one day she comes over to cuddle and I'm baked out of my mind. We lay down together lights off and she starts grinding against me which is pretty normal at this point. I'm barely paying attention but just briefly I notice something that feels different and so I say \"hey wait, what was that?\" and she goes \"It was just the tip.\"\n\nNow I was baked out of my mind and was comfortable, I was too relaxed to move let alone get upset, but if sex was a line I didn't want to cross then unprotected sex was a **hard** line I ***really*** didn't want to cross.  \nSo I say, \"Look, If you're gonna pull something like that then you might as well just go grab a condom and go ham\" which wasn't really an invitation but she thought it was and immediately jumped up to go get a condom.  \nAll I remember after that is being a lot less comfortable. She must have been riding it at an off angle or something cuz there was so much pressure on the base of my dick.\n\nShe knew I was high and all. But idk, I still think coerced describes the situation a lot better than raped does. Mainly because it wasn't just the one night, that wasn't the only time we had sex, just the first, and by that point I was already plenty comfortable with a fairly high level of intimacy so it didn't feel like it made much of a difference. It was 4 months of gradual opportunistic coercion and manipulation, eroding the few boundaries I had very clearly initially laid down.\n\nI got a therapist right after in 2022 but largely avoided the subject initially. Once I finally felt more comfortable talking about it I didn't really feel the need to anymore and there were more pressing mental health subjects to tackle with my therapist.  \n\"you were not *friends* and you did not just '*cut ties* with a *close friend*', you were *coerced* into a *manipulative romantic relationship* that you were ***somehow*** **kept unaware of** and that was a *break up*\" is a heck of a realization, sure... But after coming to that realization it's a lot easier to make peace with the whole experience.  \nI'm sure there is deeper trauma there that I need to sort out but largely the two main reasons I haven't moved on from it are because\n\n1. I find it fascinating.   \nI was in a state of confusion from beginning to end, making sense of what actually happened those 4 months is like a puzzle. ^((This is why I thought the flair \")*^(kink introspection\")* ^(probably fit the best))\n2. I find it **incredibly hot**.   \nThinking back on everything is such a turn on. \n\nIt's reassuring to know that being turned on by it is normal and okay.   \nHopefully this is close enough to what this subreddit is about, I wouldn't really know where else to talk about it.   \n","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"4 months of madness","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Rapekink","hidden":false,"pwls":null,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_1dlxajv","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.86,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":73,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"author_fullname":"t2_337xzhl3","secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"kink introspection","can_mod_post":false,"score":73,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1719067597,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.Rapekink","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I (21m) had an experience back in 2021 spanning across 4 months (September through till December) where I was heavily coerced and manipulated and I still haven&#39;t really gotten over it yet.
