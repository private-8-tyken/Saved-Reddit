Definetely not before doing it before the first time having sex.\nFucking a few times, [taken from my personal experience, ofc] is a crucial step towards stablishing that Relationship of Trust you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my guess here is that if one comes with this kind of conversation too early on, 1 or 2 from my previous comment will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I&amp;#39;m disincouraging communication, all I&amp;#39;m saying here its that in reality, that ideal of talking about eachother&amp;#39;s sexual interests rarely works before getting intimate beforehand&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I asked:\n\nA) how much they like the thing, and\nB) how much they’ve encountered men doing the thing.\n\nMy question here is, what is currently being neglected in the marketplace of sex acts? What is the cluster of things you can do that a woman is most likely to both want, and find other men lacking in? What’s the low-hanging fruit?\n\nI only included women who’d had sex with at least 5 people (the median sex count of this sample was 13). Average age was 32, and they leaned moderately liberal.\n\nMy sample absolutely suffers from selection bias, but it’s probably exactly the selection bias you want. You’re much less likely to have casual sex with a shy, conservative woman with a low bodycount than you are the kind of woman who’s taking my survey!”",

One requires 20 minutes designing graphics with gleeful loaded language and the other involves educating the men you want to have sex with.\n\nIf you have bad sex more than a few times with the same guy, then it's your fault too.  Grow up, girls.  If a man walked in already perfect at your exact flavor of sex, your *ideal* man, he wouldn't ever call you back because HE would already know the best part about sex is the intimacy and connection.  We gotta stop gaslighting and brainwashing guys into thinking there is any one reliable way to get good at sex so WE don't have to lift a finger to get what we want.  If YOUR chosen regular partner is noticeably bad at sex and you let it go on for more than a month or so, then that's YOUR CHOICE, but don't forget that YOU are the one who chooses to *CONTINUE* to have bad sex.  And if you're jumping from partner to partner, wtf do you expect???  Of course there are never gonna be guys specifically good at what YOU want if you (and sexually active women in general) don't step it up and guide them through the basics a few times!\n\nGah I'm so sick of this BS being treated as anything but what it is: an entitled and self-obsessed woman grandstands about what she--oh sorry I mean WE AS WOMEN--shouldn't have to deal with because ooohhhh look at her she did SO much work and she's SO modern that she has sex REGULARLY OOOOOHHHHH.  Men don't owe you anything if you refuse to be the one to help them help you, being a man doesn't mean you're automatically selfish in bed, and OP does NOT represent women who actually want good sex.  I will not have you associated with me.\n\nIf you're reading this, just know the following.  If you want to dunk on lazy fuckboys who don't put in any effort and are casually misogynistic...then you have to be willing and ready to dunk on entitled lazy-ass women who think that just \"being them\" is enough to deserve tailored intimate experiences.",
