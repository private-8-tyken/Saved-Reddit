Earlier this week, though, I broke down. I needed it. So I went back onto Tinder and used my old process - a lot of swiping, looking for men who were traveling, who didn't want anything serious. Preferably older. If they mention discreet in their profile, I know what to expect and it usually works well. \n\nI matched with Tom (name changed, ofc) pretty quickly and we started messaging. In his pictures, I would say he looked 50 - not 42 like he said. He was reasonably fit, though, and tall. He was enjoyably blunt, which I love. Within 30 minutes, he had already told me where and when to meet him. A bar near his hotel. \n\nI dressed my part. A smaller black dress, heels, hair down and a bit messy. I had told him that I had already drank a little that day and he didn't mind, so I had another shot before calling my uber. I met him there at 9, he was already at the bar waiting. It felt almost comfortable walking back into a situation like that after so long. The way he stared at me, feeling other eyes on me too. He was a decent conversationalist, too. Ring on his hand. I didn't ask, he didn't mention it.\n\nWe chatted at the bar for a bit, he kept my drinks coming and I kept my hand on his thigh. The music was decent, we danced together a bit and I also danced on my own and he just watched. At one point, he was chatting with another guy at the bar, too. They talked me into dancing with him a little as well, he wasn't nearly as attractive but I went for it. It was fun feeling his hands all over me, my 'date' watching, and I 'won' an extra shot for doing it and for letting him reach around a bit and grab at my chest.\n\nAround midnight, we left the bar. His hotel was just across the parking lot. Honestly, a bit of a trashy place, more motel than hotel. Once we got into his room, he offered me some other stuff and I enjoyed. He just watched. After that, he started getting handsy. I was feeling a bit out of it but had perked up and knew it was time to 'go for it.' So I started mumbling my 'no' and 'I should go home.' At one point I had my phone out and uber open. He just grabbed my phone out of my hands and tossed it across the room. He pushed me down onto the bed, face first, and shoved my dress up. He was pulling my hair when he pushed inside. Calling me a whore, a slut, a tease. Saying how he knew I wanted it since I was so wet. And I definitely was. \n\nHe lasted a while, fucking me like that. He started choking me at one point, I was still face down into the blankets and his grip was really firm, so it was actually hard to breath. My head was swimming when he finished inside me. He left me like that for a minute and went to the bathroom. I guess I decided I wasn't done, though - when he came back and turned me over, I just blurted out without really thinking \"do you treat your wife like you, sicko?\"\n\nThat hit hurt so much and he was back on me right away. I tried pushing back and my dress was torn a bit in the fight. I was surprised that he was already hard again. He shoved me down and had it in my mouth. I was gagging a lot - drinking makes it a bit harder to control and it felt like he was just attacking my throat. It went for a while and then he suddenly just pulled out and finished on me. I don't really remember much after that, I kinda passed out there and woke up laying on the floor a couple hours later. He was in the bed. He woke up when I started moving to leave. He didn't say anything, he just watched me try to clean up a little and find my phone.\n\nLooking back on it, it was what I needed at the time. I hate myself a little for caving in and doing it again but it is such an intense and irreplaceable feeling that chatting on here or whatever just can't come close to matching. Willing to chat more about it or answer questions or whatever.","author":"[deleted]","author_fullname":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","created_utc":1714136132,"is_self":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/1cdkoxm/right_back_at_it_tinder_baiting/","domain":"self.Rapekink","post_hint":null,"is_gallery":false,"over_18":true,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":"rape baiting","is_original_content":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"num_comments":6,"score":273,"upvote_ratio":0.99,"media":{"kind":"self","files":[]},"external_link":null,"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"I (f/22) have been trying to be better about things and to bait less.
