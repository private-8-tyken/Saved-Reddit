  "title": "My first night at college ended in an intoxicated rape",
  "selftext": "When I  (F31) was a freshman in college (18), I was away from home for the first time. I grew up in an incredibly small, white, conservative town, from an extremely conservative religious family. My father was an Evangelical nutjob who believed I was sinful for being raped by his best friend, rather than blaming his best friend for raping me. This was a previous experience that, for various reasons, I shouldn't discuss here. The point being, by the time I got to college, I had grown up extremely sheltered and had already been raped once by a man almost three times my age. So I had some baggage to deal with.\n\nMy first night in the college dorm rooms was a week before classes commenced for the Fall semester. I was terrified to be on my own for the first time, but thrilled at the freedom it brought. So when another girl on my floor popped her head into my open doorway and told me that a couple of the football players on our floor had brought vodka and were having a \"hang,\" I jumped at the opportunity for a new experience that I knew would piss my father off.\n\nThe hang ended up being in another dorm, with three guys and four girls, myself included. The three guys were all football players, and the biggest one was named Terrell. He was a light-skinned Black boy and he  was *big.* Easily 6'3\", with the football player build. He was wide enough across that he could break me if he wanted to. As the night wore on and the drinks flowed, he got pretty flirtatious with me and one other girl. She wasn't drinking as much, probably because she didn't have something to prove to her asshole father. Meanwhile, I was throwing back shot after shot without any understanding of what was happening to my body as a result.\n\nRemember how I said I grew up in a small conservative town? Yeah, well Terrell was the first Black guy I had really ever seen or spent time around in real life. Sure, I'd seen Black men on TV and movies, and when I'd occasionally go into the nearest city, I would see Black people around, but I never actually had a conversation with anybody other than white people. It was an aspect of my upbringing that I now am able to recognize as racist microaggression; you don't have to recognize someone's humanity if you don't talk to them like a human.\n\nSo I was *very* in my head as I was talking to Terrell, and as I got drunker, I got less inhibited. And boy oh boy. I was into him after talking to him for five minutes. The confidence. The cockiness. His *size*. The other girls were also getting drunk and were both making eyes at Terrell. I felt like I had to make a move or lose his interest. So, drunkenly, I got bold and stupid and I asked Terrell if he wanted to go back to my room. My roommate hadn't moved in yet, so I had the entire dorm to myself. He smiled a self-assured smile, grabbed his gym bag, and said, \"Lead the way.\"\n\nWhen we got back to my room, which was on the same floor but on the opposite end, I asked what he wanted to do. I was so drunk and inexperienced that it ended up coming out \"mwhatcha wanna dooo?\" He laughed and sat down on the bed. He told me to open the window, then he reached into his gym bag and pulled out a lighter, a small glass pipe, and a small plastic baggie filled with green buds. I didn't know what it was at first, but he opened the bag, gave it a great big sniff, then sighed contentedly. He offered me the bag. I had never smoked weed before (oh how times have changed!) but I was immediately in love with the smell. I still am to this day.\n\nAs he packed the bowl, we talked. I told him I was a \"pot virgin,\" which made him laugh with this cocky fucking smirk on his face that I can still picture with perfect clarity. I was eager to try anything that would piss off my dad, so I was down for it. Terrell picked the buds apart, packing gently but firmly, and told me to open the window. My dorm window was at the head of my bed on the side I had picked, and it opened up into the courtyard of student housing.\n\nI leaned over my bed and pillows to open the window. Then I felt him cup my ass with his massive hand. I would have jumped if I were sober and had normal reaction times. However, in my already-drunken state, all that ended up coming out sounded like a soft moan. I heard him chuckle, then the flick of the lighter. I turned and saw as he lit up, breathed deep like he had been doing this for years, and exhaled. He blew smoke out my dorm room window, across my face but not directly into it. I watched with drunken fascination, and my gaze kept moving to his huge hands holding the tiny pipe. He watched me watching him, then held out the pipe and lighter. \"Wanna hit it?\"\n\nOf course I did. I wanted to experience everything that had been withheld from me growing up, including the very normal experience of getting high for the first time. Of course, coupled with already being drunk, I had no idea what sort of effect that would have on me. Regardless, I said yes. That's when that cocky fucking smirk crept back onto his face.\n\n\"Then you'll have to take your shirt off.\"\n\nI didn't like being given an ultimatum. I thought about saying no, but then considered. I wanted to experiment, to experience novelty. And my drunken brain computed that he was already in my room. People clearly saw him leave with me, fully consenting (this was before drunkenness was recognized as non-consent), and knew I was alone with him now. They were obviously going to think something was going on. It's not like anyone would believe me if I said no and he forced himself on me. All this was obviously taking too long to compute, because Terrell started to pull the offered pipe back.\n\nI sighed and lifted up my shirt, extricating myself as well as I could while leaving my bra on. At the time, I was a recently developed and respectable D cup, with soft, pale, natural tits and large pink nipples that I was very self-conscious about. The puffy edges of my areolas poked out over the cups of my bra, giving him a clear view of what was waiting underneath.\n\nHe smiled like he just won a bet with himself, then passed me the pipe and lighter. \"I want you to take three deep hits, little girl. Can you do that for me?\" I'm almost 5'8\". I'm not exactly a tiny girl. But something about this huge Black man calling me \"little girl\" and telling me what to do like I was a child made me feel several feelings. I was furious with how he was speaking to me. I was humiliated that he was able to speak to me like that. I was so turned on by those two things, and by his huge, domineering, impossibly strong body. And I was drunk and in a new place for the first time.\n\nI took the pipe and the lighter, pressed the glass to my lips, and lit the lighter. Terrell had to show me how to hold it to keep the choke covered until the hit was done. The feeling of his huge, warm hands on mine was exhilarating; it was the first time I had paid attention to the difference not only in our size, but in our skin color. The contrast was incredibly novel. I took my first hit, coughed horrendously and wheezed like an asthmatic nerd being chased by bullies in a Stephen King novel. Terrell laughed at me as he reclaimed the pipe to keep anything from spilling.\n\nDespite the weight of the intoxicants in my body at the time, I still remember that Terrell was wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt. He dressed like a fucking slob. Maybe it's all that fit him. Maybe he had been working out earlier or something. Either way, when he leaned over and started to press his tongue into my mouth, I felt the sheer weight of his cock flop semi-erectly onto my thigh. I was ready for neither, and tried to push him back and away from me. I might as well have been pushing against a wall.\n\nTerrell had the single most girthy cock I've ever seen in real life. He honestly looked like a fucking Arizona Iced Tea can. He asked if I wanted another hit, and when I nodded dumbly, he told me to take off my bra. I met his eyes, but I was unfocused and dazed. He reached behind me and, with a single practiced motion, unclasped my bra with one hand. I was starting to feel the weed hitting, like a fog hanging off of the swamp of alcohol I had already ingested. Terrell pushed the pipe back to my mouth and lit the lighter again with my hand, guiding it with his fingers. He forced me to take another hit. This time it went down smoother. He asked me how I felt and I mumbled as the haze settled onto my brain. I was almost passed out, or at least that's what I remember it feeling like. He smiled and held up the pipe to my mouth. I leaned in to meet it, and he pulled it away with a condescending laugh and a \"sike!\" gesture.\n\n\"Ah-ah-ah, not yet! Pants first.\"\n\nI stood, stumbled, unbuttoned my pants, fell backward onto the bed, and pulled them down around my ass. That was the best I could do. He finished the rest, pulling my pants and panties off in the same forceful motion. Then he sat me up, leaning me against his huge body, and held the pipe to my mouth again. I was dizzy, but I opened my mouth and breathed in as he lit me up once more. It was a huge, lung-burning hit, and my eyes went bleary. My mind swam and desperation struggled to the surface of my thoughts as I realized I was gone. Worse, I coughed violently, expelling a cloud of acrid smoke right in Terrell's face. The giant fucker started laughing at me! \"Dumbass white girl can't take a hit and she thinks she can take my shit,\" he remarked, as if to an audience. I still remember that clearly because it was so bizarre to hear him call his penis \"my shit.\" It just stuck with me, and it gets me crazy guilty wet now every time I hear it elsewhere.\n\nI know that I never saw Terrell naked. He didn't even bother. He put my hand on his sweat pants and pulled them down around his cock and balls. Then he pushed me down onto the bed. The sudden movement made my head spin, and my body felt like I was rocking on a boat in choppy waters. He reached down and rubbed his head against my entrance. Maybe it was the novelty and excitement, maybe it was the intoxicating substances coursing through my body, but I was *soaked*. Even so, I was nervous and inexperienced, and I knew this wasn't what I was supposed to be doing. Too late, I tried to tell him, \"No, I'm not ready for this. I need to sober up.\" What came out was \"Nooo, mmmnot ready...\"\n\nHe laughed at me, then pushed his hips forward, shoving his massive head inside me. \"Fuckin' hell you're not! You're the wettest bitch I ever fucked!\" He started sinking his cock deeper into me, and I started to panic. Some part of me wanted this, sure, but a much larger part knew something in this dynamic was wrong. I tried to push him off—laughable, even if I were sober. I tried to wriggle out from under him. I only managed to grind my clit against his stubbled pelvic bone as he thrust himself deep, and I let out a groan that sounded more like a barn animal than a college freshman. I couldn't get away, and I couldn't escape the incredible sensations I was feeling. The fear, the guilt, the vodka, the weed, all alchemized into the single most earth-shatteringly intense orgasm I've still ever experienced.\n\nHe groaned as he felt me cumming. He was so thick that my walls were milking him. He was more experienced, but still a young guy, and the feeling of a cross-faded girl trying to struggle out from under him only to accidentally make herself cum was something he couldn't handle without reaction. He wore no condom. I was too out of it to think of it. I wasn't on birth control, obviously. So when he emptied his load inside me, I felt his cum beat at my insides and he screamed like he was being murdered. He kept cumming, growling, and groaning, treating me like a cumdump for his impressive load.\n\nAfterwards, he collapsed on top of me, and I felt like I was going to suffocate under his mass. After a minute or two, he got up, wiped his cock on my thigh, and dressed himself.\n\n\"We should do this again sometime,\" he said. He grabbed his weed and his bag, and let himself out of my dorm, leaving me naked, shaking, used, wasted, and dripping his cum. It was my second sexual experience ever. It was my first night at college. It was rape, again, but almost not? I've never quite figured out how I feel about it outside of \"turned on and guilty as fuck.\"\n\nWhat do you guys think? I truly do feel like I was raped, but is it rape if I enjoyed it?",

I felt like I had to make a move or lose his interest. So, drunkenly, I got bold and stupid and I asked Terrell if he wanted to go back to my room. My roommate hadn&#39;t moved in yet, so I had the entire dorm to myself. He smiled a self-assured smile, grabbed his gym bag, and said, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When we got back to my room, which was on the same floor but on the opposite end, I asked what he wanted to do. I was so drunk and inexperienced that it ended up coming out &quot;mwhatcha wanna dooo?&quot; He laughed and sat down on the bed. He told me to open the window, then he reached into his gym bag and pulled out a lighter, a small glass pipe, and a small plastic baggie filled with green buds. I didn&#39;t know what it was at first, but he opened the bag, gave it a great big sniff, then sighed contentedly. He offered me the bag. I had never smoked weed before (oh how times have changed!) but I was immediately in love with the smell. I still am to this day.</p>\n\n<p>As he packed the bowl, we talked. I told him I was a &quot;pot virgin,&quot; which made him laugh with this cocky fucking smirk on his face that I can still picture with perfect clarity. I was eager to try anything that would piss off my dad, so I was down for it. Terrell picked the buds apart, packing gently but firmly, and told me to open the window. My dorm window was at the head of my bed on the side I had picked, and it opened up into the courtyard of student housing.</p>\n\n<p>I leaned over my bed and pillows to open the window. Then I felt him cup my ass with his massive hand. I would have jumped if I were sober and had normal reaction times. However, in my already-drunken state, all that ended up coming out sounded like a soft moan. I heard him chuckle, then the flick of the lighter. I turned and saw as he lit up, breathed deep like he had been doing this for years, and exhaled. He blew smoke out my dorm room window, across my face but not directly into it. I watched with drunken fascination, and my gaze kept moving to his huge hands holding the tiny pipe. He watched me watching him, then held out the pipe and lighter. &quot;Wanna hit it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Of course I did. I wanted to experience everything that had been withheld from me growing up, including the very normal experience of getting high for the first time. Of course, coupled with already being drunk, I had no idea what sort of effect that would have on me. Regardless, I said yes. That&#39;s when that cocky fucking smirk crept back onto his face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then you&#39;ll have to take your shirt off.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t like being given an ultimatum. I thought about saying no, but then considered. I wanted to experiment, to experience novelty. And my drunken brain computed that he was already in my room. People clearly saw him leave with me, fully consenting (this was before drunkenness was recognized as non-consent), and knew I was alone with him now. They were obviously going to think something was going on. It&#39;s not like anyone would believe me if I said no and he forced himself on me. All this was obviously taking too long to compute, because Terrell started to pull the offered pipe back.</p>\n\n<p>I sighed and lifted up my shirt, extricating myself as well as I could while leaving my bra on. At the time, I was a recently developed and respectable D cup, with soft, pale, natural tits and large pink nipples that I was very self-conscious about. The puffy edges of my areolas poked out over the cups of my bra, giving him a clear view of what was waiting underneath.</p>\n\n<p>He smiled like he just won a bet with himself, then passed me the pipe and lighter. &quot;I want you to take three deep hits, little girl. Can you do that for me?&quot; I&#39;m almost 5&#39;8&quot;. I&#39;m not exactly a tiny girl. But something about this huge Black man calling me &quot;little girl&quot; and telling me what to do like I was a child made me feel several feelings. I was furious with how he was speaking to me. I was humiliated that he was able to speak to me like that. I was so turned on by those two things, and by his huge, domineering, impossibly strong body. And I was drunk and in a new place for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>I took the pipe and the lighter, pressed the glass to my lips, and lit the lighter. Terrell had to show me how to hold it to keep the choke covered until the hit was done. The feeling of his huge, warm hands on mine was exhilarating; it was the first time I had paid attention to the difference not only in our size, but in our skin color. The contrast was incredibly novel. I took my first hit, coughed horrendously and wheezed like an asthmatic nerd being chased by bullies in a Stephen King novel. Terrell laughed at me as he reclaimed the pipe to keep anything from spilling.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the weight of the intoxicants in my body at the time, I still remember that Terrell was wearing sweat pants and a sweatshirt. He dressed like a fucking slob. Maybe it&#39;s all that fit him. Maybe he had been working out earlier or something. Either way, when he leaned over and started to press his tongue into my mouth, I felt the sheer weight of his cock flop semi-erectly onto my thigh. I was ready for neither, and tried to push him back and away from me. I might as well have been pushing against a wall.</p>\n\n<p>Terrell had the single most girthy cock I&#39;ve ever seen in real life. He honestly looked like a fucking Arizona Iced Tea can. He asked if I wanted another hit, and when I nodded dumbly, he told me to take off my bra. I met his eyes, but I was unfocused and dazed. He reached behind me and, with a single practiced motion, unclasped my bra with one hand. I was starting to feel the weed hitting, like a fog hanging off of the swamp of alcohol I had already ingested. Terrell pushed the pipe back to my mouth and lit the lighter again with my hand, guiding it with his fingers. He forced me to take another hit. This time it went down smoother. He asked me how I felt and I mumbled as the haze settled onto my brain. I was almost passed out, or at least that&#39;s what I remember it feeling like. He smiled and held up the pipe to my mouth. I leaned in to meet it, and he pulled it away with a condescending laugh and a &quot;sike!&quot; gesture.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah-ah-ah, not yet! Pants first.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I stood, stumbled, unbuttoned my pants, fell backward onto the bed, and pulled them down around my ass. That was the best I could do. He finished the rest, pulling my pants and panties off in the same forceful motion. Then he sat me up, leaning me against his huge body, and held the pipe to my mouth again. I was dizzy, but I opened my mouth and breathed in as he lit me up once more. It was a huge, lung-burning hit, and my eyes went bleary. My mind swam and desperation struggled to the surface of my thoughts as I realized I was gone. Worse, I coughed violently, expelling a cloud of acrid smoke right in Terrell&#39;s face. The giant fucker started laughing at me! &quot;Dumbass white girl can&#39;t take a hit and she thinks she can take my shit,&quot; he remarked, as if to an audience. I still remember that clearly because it was so bizarre to hear him call his penis &quot;my shit.&quot; It just stuck with me, and it gets me crazy guilty wet now every time I hear it elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>I know that I never saw Terrell naked. He didn&#39;t even bother. He put my hand on his sweat pants and pulled them down around his cock and balls. Then he pushed me down onto the bed. The sudden movement made my head spin, and my body felt like I was rocking on a boat in choppy waters. He reached down and rubbed his head against my entrance. Maybe it was the novelty and excitement, maybe it was the intoxicating substances coursing through my body, but I was <em>soaked</em>. Even so, I was nervous and inexperienced, and I knew this wasn&#39;t what I was supposed to be doing. Too late, I tried to tell him, &quot;No, I&#39;m not ready for this. I need to sober up.&quot; What came out was &quot;Nooo, mmmnot ready...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He laughed at me, then pushed his hips forward, shoving his massive head inside me. &quot;Fuckin&#39; hell you&#39;re not! You&#39;re the wettest bitch I ever fucked!&quot; He started sinking his cock deeper into me, and I started to panic. Some part of me wanted this, sure, but a much larger part knew something in this dynamic was wrong. I tried to push him off—laughable, even if I were sober. I tried to wriggle out from under him. I only managed to grind my clit against his stubbled pelvic bone as he thrust himself deep, and I let out a groan that sounded more like a barn animal than a college freshman. I couldn&#39;t get away, and I couldn&#39;t escape the incredible sensations I was feeling. The fear, the guilt, the vodka, the weed, all alchemized into the single most earth-shatteringly intense orgasm I&#39;ve still ever experienced.</p>\n\n<p>He groaned as he felt me cumming. He was so thick that my walls were milking him. He was more experienced, but still a young guy, and the feeling of a cross-faded girl trying to struggle out from under him only to accidentally make herself cum was something he couldn&#39;t handle without reaction. He wore no condom. I was too out of it to think of it. I wasn&#39;t on birth control, obviously. So when he emptied his load inside me, I felt his cum beat at my insides and he screamed like he was being murdered. He kept cumming, growling, and groaning, treating me like a cumdump for his impressive load.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, he collapsed on top of me, and I felt like I was going to suffocate under his mass. After a minute or two, he got up, wiped his cock on my thigh, and dressed himself.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We should do this again sometime,&quot; he said. He grabbed his weed and his bag, and let himself out of my dorm, leaving me naked, shaking, used, wasted, and dripping his cum. It was my second sexual experience ever. It was my first night at college. It was rape, again, but almost not? I&#39;ve never quite figured out how I feel about it outside of &quot;turned on and guilty as fuck.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? I truly do feel like I was raped, but is it rape if I enjoyed it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I was *very* clearly intoxicated and had to be helped and supported to even walk. Could hardly speak more than a few slurred words. So they knew exactly what they were doing getting me in a room with them by myself even though I just thought they were being really nice and helpful and friendly at first. Past asking me if I wanted to go to their room, they never actually *asked* me if I wanted anything. They just demanded or told me what to do and my brain completely shut down so that I couldn't tell them no, it had been so ingrained in me that I needed to be obedient and polite and respectful, especially to men. So even though I didn't stop them and just let them do whatever they wanted to me, my consent in those situations was irrelevant for them. They weren't concerned about getting a clear answer on if I wanted it. They just wanted to use me for a good time and expected me to obey so I did. \n\nEven if your body enjoyed it, sounds to me like he knew exactly what he was doing and how he was playing into your naivete and inexperience so that there probably wasn't even a question in his mind that he was gonna use you as soon as he got you alone and he wasn't concerned on if you actually wanted it. I don't think it's anything you should feel bad about yourself for though. It probably helped that you were so easy for him to use, otherwise he might have ended up using more force or really hurting you, and in these types of situations you never really know how far a guy's willing to go to hurt you to take what he wants so it can be a lot better to be compliant and easy to control. Anyway, I'm glad that there's things you can look back on with him using you and still get pleasure from them. We can't necessarily control what makes us feel good but you still deserve to get what you need, even if it involves having a rape kink now.",

      "body": "That's something I sometimes ask myself, if it was still rape even though I submitted and complied right away and I made it so easy for them cuz of my naivete. Mine also happened when I was in college and extremely intoxicated. I told myself I was so stupid cuz I should've known from the start what they wanted, but I didn't, and just wanted so badly for someone to like me.\n\nWhat's helped me is just realizing that at the end of the day, for those guys, my consent didn't actually matter in those situations. I was *very* clearly intoxicated and had to be helped and supported to even walk. Could hardly speak more than a few slurred words. So they knew exactly what they were doing getting me in a room with them by myself even though I just thought they were being really nice and helpful and friendly at first. Past asking me if I wanted to go to their room, they never actually *asked* me if I wanted anything. They just demanded or told me what to do and my brain completely shut down so that I couldn't tell them no, it had been so ingrained in me that I needed to be obedient and polite and respectful, especially to men. So even though I didn't stop them and just let them do whatever they wanted to me, my consent in those situations was irrelevant for them. They weren't concerned about getting a clear answer on if I wanted it. They just wanted to use me for a good time and expected me to obey so I did. \n\nEven if your body enjoyed it, sounds to me like he knew exactly what he was doing and how he was playing into your naivete and inexperience so that there probably wasn't even a question in his mind that he was gonna use you as soon as he got you alone and he wasn't concerned on if you actually wanted it. I don't think it's anything you should feel bad about yourself for though. It probably helped that you were so easy for him to use, otherwise he might have ended up using more force or really hurting you, and in these types of situations you never really know how far a guy's willing to go to hurt you to take what he wants so it can be a lot better to be compliant and easy to control. Anyway, I'm glad that there's things you can look back on with him using you and still get pleasure from them. We can't necessarily control what makes us feel good but you still deserve to get what you need, even if it involves having a rape kink now.",

But once every month or so he'd knock on my door and ask if my roommate was around.

I usually got weed out of it though.",
