  "selftext": "\n\nI was always so scared around him, it really was like walking on a minefield, I was just always waiting for the next thing to blow up. Constantly begging for forgiveness. Constant crying. Always sky high anxiety.\n\nHe had been screaming at me, I was crying. \n\nHe got his phone out and took a selfie with me, hugging me, making me smile at the camera. He grabs my breast.. out of nowhere? \n\nSuddenly he’s nice again. Like nothing happened. \n\nHe starts lifting my shirt, I try to laugh it off and squirm my way out but he doesn’t let me, he takes it off and then takes his clothes off, I feel so weird, I’m getting whiplash from being screamed at to almost seconds later having him be happy and playful? I feel gross, I wanna get away. \n\nHe tells me to get on the bed, I reluctantly do, he tells me to take my clothes off, I just do it. I feel sick, he’s being sweet? Why? He gets on top, spits on his fingers and then shoves them in. It burns, I don’t want this, please don’t, please stop, please just let this all stop. \n\nHe takes them out and puts them in my mouth, then just starts fucking me, hard and fast, I’m just whimpering from the pain. I just want to die, make it all stop. \n\nIt doesn’t end, I’m just laying here frozen in time and it doesn’t stop. He pulls out and jerks off on to my body. He throws paper at me, puts some clothes back on and then goes to his computer and starts showing me something on there. \n\nAgain like nothing just happened, like I didn’t just die and he fucked my breathing corpse. I wipe it off, I wanna run away, he’s telling me to do this first. I don’t remember what, something on the computer, something normal.\n\nEverything is ok, I think? It’s fine. I’m fine. Focus on whatever it is, let’s just move on and forget.\n\nAfter he’s done showing me whatever, he comes back to the bed, I think I’m gonna be sick, he takes his clothes off again. Whiplash.\n\n“Get up.” I sit still. “On your hands and knees.” I’m frozen. I can’t. He sighs. Oh no. I get up. He lets me stand there for a while, because I hate it, “tell me you want me inside you, tell me to fuck you”, I can’t handle this. \n\n“SAY IT.” I say it. “Louder” I just do it, there’s no way out. I can’t breathe. \n\nHe gets up behind me and starts fucking me. I can’t handle it, please just kill me. I’m so disgusting. The shame I feel is indescribable. He pulls my hair, punches the back of my head, spanks me, I’m just dying. I’m not even whimpering despite the pain, I’m just dead. \n\nAgain it never ends, just pain. Just despair. Just helpless. Pathetic. Stupid. Disgusting. Broken. \n\nHe pulls out and tells me to get on my knees, I just do it. He fucks my face and jerks off into my eyes. And throws more tissues on me. \n\nPuts his clothes on and moves on. He’s happy, smiling. I’m dying.\n\n\n\n",
