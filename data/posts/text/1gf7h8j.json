  "title": "My boyfriend anally raped me while I was sick",
  "selftext": "This happened almost three years ago when I (F, 19 at the time) had fallen sick. I was home alone and was understandably feeling weak and so I laid in bed all day. I had been sick for about two days when my boyfriend messaged me in the evening saying he'd come over to see me and “check up on me”. I refused at first, not wanting him to get sick, but he said he'd be fine and just wanted to see me, and so I agreed.\n\nI unlocked the door a few minutes before he arrived when I went to the kitchen, so that I wouldn't have to get up again when he got here, as just standing up and walking around required so much energy I didn't have. About twenty minutes later I heard him opening and locking the front door. He came in my room and sat next to me on the bed. I said his name and greeted him. He pet my head as I was laid down and then put his hand on my shoulder and said he had missed me. We hadn't seen each other for about five days at that point. He kept caressing my shoulder and then squeezed me a little and smiled, saying again how he had missed me. I just smiled back and he said he wanted to \"play with me a little\". I really did not feel up to it and told him so. I don't refuse him normally but at that moment I felt like I was fighting just to stay alive. He replied saying he'd be quick. I tiredly said I wasn't sure but he already got onto my bed and crawled on top of me. I was laying down on my belly with my head on my pillow, covered by a blanket that he pulled off.\n\nHe then pressed his crotch against my butt and rubbed himself on me left to right multiple times and groaned. I felt his hard dick on me. I was tired and thought about how I did not really want this, but nonetheless didn't say a word, just laid still. He slid my pajama pants down just under my butt and groped my bare cheeks. I mumbled something out of habit. I think at that point he undressed, next thing I remember is hearing him spit in his hand and then feeling his wet dick between my cheeks. I recall just wanting it to be over and my head aching. \n\nHe positioned his dick against my asshole and pushed into me. He wasn't slow so it hurt. I squealed in pain into the pillow and he just kept pushing his dick in until it was fully inside, then stopped and groaned. \n\n“You're so warm”. The pain was really bad at first and I couldn't stay silent and just kept whimpering. He fucked my ass hard with his hands on the bed by my waist and kept fucking me rough for about 15 seconds. Then he pushed in the deepest he could, grunted, and came. I felt his dick throb inside my ass and he stayed like that for a second and then pulled out, wiped himself, quickly dressed up and told me to get better. He was gone not even five minutes later.\n\nI honestly felt pretty empty after this. I don't mind being alone but after he left the loneliness felt almost crushing and it wasn't pleasant. Despite it being kind of shitty, I never held it against him. I did not enjoy it in the moment or right after, but I enjoyed it later on as a memory. I suppose I'm lucky to have a rape kink in a sense. \n\n\n\n",
