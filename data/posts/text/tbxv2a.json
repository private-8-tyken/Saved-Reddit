  "title": "How I (f18) went from innocent college virgin to sex loving freak; Part 1: Peeping on a friend",
  "selftext": "I'll start with a bit of back story. How did I end up a college freshman and still a virgin?  Well for starters I attended a religious school growing up which constantly taught that premarital sex was a sin.  I never really bought into that idea but I think because of that I also never really went out of my way to have sex. I had a few boyfriends but we never really had any opportunities to be totally alone so things kind of ended and kissing and feeling each other up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also wasn't super horny growing up.  I rarely masturbated or looked at porn.  I think part of this is because I was a bit sexually confused. I thought I might be gay or bi but was taught that those feelings were immoral so it led to me repressing my sexual thoughts a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk now on to the story. I'm a shortish (5'4'') petite blonde with hair down to my mid back.  I have big brown eyes and nicely trimmed eyebrows. My cheeks are rosy and roundish and my smile is cute.  I've always get a lot of attention from guys because I have a cute face even though my boobs are a bit smallish. I was on the cheer team in hs and played tennis, so I am fit but not really muscular at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get dropped off at college about a week before class and meet my new roommate; Ashley. She actually looks a lot like me just with a little bigger boobs, blonder hair, and a bit taller.  People often used to ask if we were sisters.  Maybe I will describe what she looks like more in another story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first thought of her was \"omg she has a lot of skin showing\".  I was used to a dress code and parents that somewhat monitored my clothes (they weren't crazy but wouldn't let me wear anything super revealing).  She was wearing tiny blue shorts that were like basically a swimsuit and a top which exposed her entire stomach.  On top of that all she was walking around the coed dorm not shy at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe became friends quickly. Ashley is funny and really nice. We actually have a lot in common. We watched some of the same shows, liked similar music, and both did cheer in high school.  We made friends with other girls on our floor but her and I were always the closest.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore class had started for the year Ashley and I were close friends.  She had opened up and told me about some of the troubles she faced growing up with her mom and some of the difficulties of having parents that are split up.  She also opened up to me about her bf and her sex life.  She had just starting dating a guy a few months before leaving for college. That was a huge mistake she said. She wanted to break up with him before she left but when she went to his house to do it they ended up having sex for two days straight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kind of laughed nervously when she told me all this. I wasn't used to talking about sexual stuff and it embarrassed me. Ashley was good at talking to me and getting me to open up. She quickly had me admitting that I was a virgin and had never done anything really sexual with a guy (at this point I had never even orgasmed on my own).  She was really cool and didn't make fun of me or anything. She just calmly said \"Well, that'll change if you want it to\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat statement opened my eyes. I realized, \"Yeah I could have sex if I want to\".  No parents. No rules. I kind of liked that idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we get to the last weekend before school starts. It's Friday night and a bunch of girls on our floor were invited to a frat party.  I have drank before but I never partied much. Someone got us a couple bottles of UV lemonade. Those girls could party lol.  The were drinking 3 times as much as I was just in the pregame and I was probably the drunkest of all.  We went and showered and met back in our room to get changed. There were 4 of us in all. Ashley and another girl stripped completely naked and asked for some advice on clothing. Ashley even joked \"underwear or no?\". \"In that skirt you better wear underwear\" we all agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing them change I realized I was completely unshaven.  The other girls had pretty clearly just shaved. I was looking very bushy. I had never seriously considered shaving before. I trim enough to look good in a swimsuit but thats about it. I was pretty embarrassed and I think the other girls could tell. This was also the first time I had seen other girls so comfortably naked right in front of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe go to this frat party and it is super fun. We are dancing. The music is loud. I am very drunk and so are my friends. I am wearing a white dress with lacy trim and a brown belt.  It isn't super revealing but I think it is pretty hot. Ashley is dancing with a guy and I see her talk to some other guy and point at me. He comes over and we start dancing. He is very handsy and feeling me up. A couple times I had to stop him from putting his hand in my panties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am way drunk and this guy starts to lead me to his room. We start to kiss right away. It's super hot. He is laying on me with my legs spread. I can feel his cock pushing against my pussy through our clothes. We make out some more and he tries to undress me.  I get this moment of sobriety and I tell myself, \"Nooo\".  I start thinking about how drunk I am and how hairy my pussy is.  I don't want to just fuck some random guy. At this point I am still not even sure if I want to wait for marriage or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell the guy sorry and I leave. I'm really drunk but my dorm was close so I walk back alone. It's a pretty safe campus and even though it is like 2 in the morning I am fine walking by myself. I get back to my room and realize my phone is missing (luckily Ashley had it).  I changed out of my clothes, into a baggy t-shirt,  turned out the light, and laid down in bed.  I can't fall asleep. I'm replaying my night in the guys room and it is turning me on. I start to touch myself slowly. I couldn't stop thinking about how hot it was to have a guy laying on me with his cock pushed up against my panties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure how long I was doing this for when my dorm room door opened and Ashley walked in. She whispered something but I couldn't hear what. I was about to respond when I realized she wasn't alone.  She had brought back the guy! Immediately I froze and pretended to be asleep.  I really wasn't sure what I should do. I heard Ashley whisper, \"I think she's asleep\". Although it wasn't much of a whisper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAshley has two night lights on two of her bed posts which she turned on.  They aren't very bright but I could see right away she was naked. I squinted my eyes so I could see them. Somehow I was afraid they would know if my eyes were wide open.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI caught a glimpse of his dick and then Ashley's mouth over it.  It was hard to see much but I could hear her giving him a bj. I was still frozen. Terrified I would be caught watching.  I saw a shift and the sounds changed. I think she was on top of him having sex. My first thought was \"Oh no, you have a boyfriend\".  The shock started to wear off and I realized my hand was still right on my pussy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was too nervous to really masturbate. I just applied a little pressure while I watched and listened to my roommate saying \"yeah baby fuck me more, harder, oh yeah\", as well as other drunken dirty talk. I kept watching and the whole time. Finally they finished and he left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning could have been super awkward but fortunately Ashley is cool.  She asked if I did anything with that guy and I told her we made out but I was kinda nervous and didn't go further.  She then shyly asked me if I heard anything last night.  I lied and said no.  She called my bluff and said\"BS. I know you heard.\"  We talked about it a little. She said she texted her bf and broke up with him last night before it happened (I think maybe that was not true).  She also got me to admit that I listened and that it was kind of hot.  She asked me if I fingered myself while I listened.  I turned bright red from embarrassment. How the F did she know all this?? I lied and said no. (I guess i didn't really finger because I was nervous, but I did have my hand on my clit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last thing she said to me after I denied doing it was, \"You should have\" followed by a laugh.",

Immediately I froze and pretended to be asleep.  I really wasn&amp;#39;t sure what I should do. I heard Ashley whisper, &amp;quot;I think she&amp;#39;s asleep&amp;quot;. Although it wasn&amp;#39;t much of a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley has two night lights on two of her bed posts which she turned on.  They aren&amp;#39;t very bright but I could see right away she was naked. I squinted my eyes so I could see them. Somehow I was afraid they would know if my eyes were wide open.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I caught a glimpse of his dick and then Ashley&amp;#39;s mouth over it.  It was hard to see much but I could hear her giving him a bj. I was still frozen. Terrified I would be caught watching.  I saw a shift and the sounds changed. I think she was on top of him having sex. My first thought was &amp;quot;Oh no, you have a boyfriend&amp;quot;.  The shock started to wear off and I realized my hand was still right on my pussy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was too nervous to really masturbate. I just applied a little pressure while I watched and listened to my roommate saying &amp;quot;yeah baby fuck me more, harder, oh yeah&amp;quot;, as well as other drunken dirty talk. I kept watching and the whole time. Finally they finished and he left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning could have been super awkward but fortunately Ashley is cool.  She asked if I did anything with that guy and I told her we made out but I was kinda nervous and didn&amp;#39;t go further.  She then shyly asked me if I heard anything last night.  I lied and said no.  She called my bluff and said&amp;quot;BS. I know you heard.&amp;quot;  We talked about it a little. She said she texted her bf and broke up with him last night before it happened (I think maybe that was not true).  She also got me to admit that I listened and that it was kind of hot.  She asked me if I fingered myself while I listened.  I turned bright red from embarrassment. How the F did she know all this?? I lied and said no. (I guess i didn&amp;#39;t really finger because I was nervous, but I did have my hand on my clit).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing she said to me after I denied doing it was, &amp;quot;You should have&amp;quot; followed by a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
