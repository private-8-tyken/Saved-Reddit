  "selftext": "So M and I have been friends (and fwb) online for around two years when I finally got the chance to visit & stay over at his place. M is incredibly respectful towards me so even though it went unsaid it was obvious that he was only ever going to follow my lead. I was only gonna be in the area for two months so I knew I needed to make a move soon or nothing was going to happen. \nThe first time I stayed at his place was for three nights; I was still too shy to do anything, I would only change clothes in a different room and slept on his couch rather than joining him in bed. Nonetheless the tension was high the entire stay, mostly from what I discovered was the most fun I could have without pulling down his pants. I’ve always enjoyed a little roughhousing and being near someone who was having a hard time holding himself back was a load of fun. \nIt started with me just using every pillow available to smack him with, often annoying him to the point of him either holding hostage every pillow he managed to grab from me or hitting me back much harder with a different pillow. A few times he’d even hold the pillow down on my face until I’d give up fighting and after letting up he’d casually call me “slut”.\nDuring one of these fights I saw that he wasn’t getting annoyed in the same kind of way, so I ditched the pillows and ended up smacking him a few times. Apparently, it worked cause we ended up wrestling a bit and he pinned me down arms behind my back and my face against the bedsheets. I feigned giving up repeatedly, jerking and pulling myself, eventually managing to maneuver my ass up against his groin. I could feel how hard he was and attempted to grind against him which only caused him to complain. Something like “oh come on that isn’t fair”. \nAfter that things didn’t go much further, because of the way he was holding me down way quickly draining the energy I had left and my air supply. I had to tap out and the rest of the visit went on like normal.\nBetween visits there was a surplus of steamy messages saying how badly we wanted each other. The best shared desire being how we thought that he should have taken advantage of me then and there.\nThe next visit was set to be longer, but I couldn’t help it, I needed to get used asap. I teased him again on that very first night, fighting like I did last time, causing myself to be pinned down again. This time he had a different attitude, maybe it was those tiny shorts I was wearing, maybe it was those lustful messages, maybe this time he stopped caring. \nWith one hand on my upper back to hold me in place, he used the other to take a nice squeeze of right ass cheek. It didn’t even really feel like lust, more like he was finally letting himself appreciate my body. He let up his other hand to bring it down to my butt and play with it how he wanted to. I tried to shimmy out from under him but he brought that hand back up to my back and that alone made it impossible. \nFrom that point was a slow start to my pleading “please”, “stop”, “no”, and any combination of the three. The pleading only got stronger when that hand moved from my cheek to between my legs, rubbing over the fabric on my shorts. Of course it felt amazing but he clearly didn’t care about my enjoyment at all, he just wanted to play with me. It wasn’t long until he pulled the crotch of my shorts and panties to the side and got presented with my pussy, shaved the night before just in case.\nHe poked around a little before he shoved a single finger inside, gently testing me out mid dealing with my struggling. For being taken advantage of, he was being incredibly gentle, until he comfortably got a second finger in. He truly was finger fucking me, the pacing was incredible and I wasn’t able to do anything about it. There were even times it got a little painful, and I’m legitimately phobic of pain, but all I could do was clench the sheets and take it and that alone made it enjoyable anyway. \nBefore I could cum he pulled his fingers out and slapped my ass a few times. Then let up off of me and got up to clean off his fingers. I just lied there, kind of in shock from what he did to me. He came back and just sat there beside me, looking me down. I must have stayed there for like 15 minutes, I have no clue if it was exhaustion, or if I was processing, or if I just didn’t want to look him in the eyes. I got up slowly, lifting myself up with my arms, finally turning my head and looked at him through the mess of hair that hung in front of my face. “You ok?” He asked. I didn’t respond, I just slowly cuddled up to him, my arm around his waist and my head against his shoulder.",
