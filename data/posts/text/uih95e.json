  "selftext": "My partner and I have been dabbling in some rougher stuff over the past six months or so as we have gotten really comfortable with each other and talking about our kinks. Even so, this one took me by surprise a little bit! But it was a fantasy of mine so I was so down.\nJ is working 4 hours away until the end of August so I don’t see him that often at the moment. I will go stay with him for up to a week at a time. Last week I left on Monday afternoon to come back home and I wasn’t expecting to see him again until this evening, but on Thursday evening he let me know that he was struggling a little with his mental health. I came straight from work to be with him the next day.\n\nThat evening we were making out and he said, very seriously, “I want to do some fucked up things to you.”\n\nNow, J and I have a very deep level of trust & understanding of limits so I immediately said “I’m yours”. If he wants it, I’m willing to try it. But this time he shook his head and said “I want you to be totally incapacitated.” I’m thinking he wants to tie me up and again, I’m down, but he carries on and says “how would you feel if I gave you something to make you kind of… out of it?”\n\nI was a little surprised, but I was totally into it. We’ve discussed before that I like when he touches me in my sleep & wanted to do more things like that. I did a quick risk assessment in my head and both of us take Xanax and are aware of how our bodies react to it. I am small so I knew a 2mg pill would make me sleepy and floppy but not totally unaware of the situation. I would never have done this with anyone else but I knew there was no possibility of him going too far.\n\nI took the pill and did everything I would usually do before bed because I knew I wouldn’t manage it later. Then I got back into bed and lay on J’s chest while we waited for the pill to kick in.\n\nAround 45 minutes or so I was pretty out of it feeling very floaty and sleepy. I felt J pulling my tights down, leaving them dangling from one leg, and he knelt between my legs and started rubbing my clit. I remember my eyes were floating between open and closed and I was doing these quiet little moans. He switched to fingering me, hard, and I remember cumming all over his hand. He said later that when I came it lasted for ages, he could just feel me gripping down on his hand.\n\nEventually he propped my legs up to fuck me. I remember him positioning me like I was a doll and I found it so hot. He fucked me for ten minutes and then rolled me over and fucked me from behind. I came three times total. Then we cuddled and I fell asleep.\n\nThe next day I said I had been expecting him to be rougher and he admitted that he had intended to, but by the time the pill kicked in he was in a more cuddly mood and he had been taken aback by how cute I looked lying there all sleepy, so he had just wanted to make me feel good.\n\nI told him I had a lot of fun and if he wanted to do it again but rougher I would be down for it! I see him again in a week.",
