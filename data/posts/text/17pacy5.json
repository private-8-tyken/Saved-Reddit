  "title": "One of the ways my Dom abused me that ruined me for life",
  "selftext": "From the age of 20 to 24, I was with a dominant man. He was supportive and loving in the beginning, and we even started camming together. It was a lot of fun at first. Making porn was not my primary source of income, but after a few months, my dom encouraged me to pursue full time content creation. We did weekly livestreams in which we messed around with bondage and kink experimentation, and one night, things started to change for the worse. I posted here about that particular incident.  I felt stuck in that situation, and the amount of things he coerced me into doing has messed me up for life. I don’t feel like I can enjoy sex without engaging in extreme behavior. It was all so confusing. I loved it at the time, because nobody had ever made me feel the way he made me feel. However, towards the end of it, I felt like a prisoner in my own skin because he had taken complete control over me. \n\nThis particular experience is from the final year of our relationship. I wanted out, but I’d been isolated from family and friends for so long, I didn’t know who to turn to, and my only source of income was camming, which I was requited to do with him because he was possessive of my body, he swore we made more money as a couple making content, and he was in full control of my money since it was technically his as well. \n\nWe did live cam streams two or three times a week. One night after dinner, he told me to go shower and get ready for a livestream so that we could “afford to get the car fixed.” I now know that it wasn’t about paying off necessities. He had been stealing money from me to pay off his debt. \n\nHe set up the laptop and camera at the kitchen table, and he told me we were going to tie my hands behind my back.  I obeyed. He told me I was allowed to speak, and that he’d tagged the livestream with “consensual nonconsent,” which meant that I could beg him to stop all I wanted, and we’d probably make more money. That felt very discouraging. We started the stream. He positioned the cam so that my face and my tits were on display. I used to not show my face, but I didn’t have a choice with him. \n\n It started out normal. People in the chat were asking him to grab my tits, pinch my nipples, shake them…everyone wanted the same thing. I remember thinking that if all we were doing was focusing on my tits, then maybe it would be so bad. But it seemed like the longer we streamed, the more unhinged the requests became. People started to ask for super specific things, like smacking them with a ruler, or torturing my nipples with clothespins. One person asked him to spit on them and rub it in. Another person asked for my dom to scrape my tits and poke my nipples with a fork, another one asked him to scrub  my breasts with the dish washing brush from the sink, which was especially awful and humiliating, because it made me feel dirty, and by the time he was done, my tits were red and sensitive to even the lightest touch. \n\nI had tears streaming down my face and I begged him to let me at least take a break. He leaned down and whispered in my ear, “That would be so disappointing for everyone who took the time to show up and pay tonight, don’t you think?” I remember questioning myself. I could feel the wetness between my legs. I hated that I was wet from the abuse, I was already desperate to finish. \n\nThis stream lasted for two and a half hours; just the two of us taking requests for different ways to torture my tits with household objects.  He even clamped my nipples with clothespins and then used my toothbrush to scrape across my nipples while they were being pinched. It hurt so bad, all I could do was cry., even as my pussy was throbbing and begging for attention between my legs. He also used pliers to pinch and twist my nipples. I remember I couldn’t help but scream. The pain was so intense, and I was terrified that he was doing permanent damage to my body. \n\nBy the time it was finally over, I felt like my consciousness had taken refuge at the back of my brain. I was not present for the end of the stream, and I barely remember being taken to bed. He loved me the most when I was in that state of mind. He said it was when I was the most obedient version of myself. I was his very, very good girl if I made it to that state of mind. He told me so as he pushed me face down into the mattress and took me from behind. My orgasm felt like it lasted for hours. \n\nWriting these out is very cathartic. I have a lot of them in the chamber, and I’m currently trying to process everything I’ve been through, so I might be posting more later down the line. My feelings about my experiences have been very confusing, because on the one hand, what I went through was pretty fucked up, but on the other, I can’t deny that I spend a lot of time touching myself to the memories…",
