For someone to have easily experienced the most intimate parts of my body against my will, I feel that the only way to lessen the meaning of it is to willingly let other men experience it. The more the better\n\nA few weeks ago I went to a music festival and experienced my first gangbang while tripping on acid. One minute I was laying on the floor with a group of guys I just met (they were in the camp next to mine). The next minute, there were hands  all over my body, caressing my breasts and thighs until they each took turns fucking me like a sex doll\n\nLast weekend I went to a party and met a guy who i've heard about. Typical frat guy who dates a new girl every few months and has cheated multiple times. Yet I still had sex with him anyway. We snuck upstairs to a bedroom (sorry whoevers bedroom that was). He barely took my clothes off because he wanted me so bad. My pants were barely down to my thighs when he shoved his cock into into me. In my mind I was screaming for more cock,  not because he wasn't big enough, but because he kept needing to pull out every few seconds to keep himself from cumming. When he finally couldnt hold it, he came inside me and collapsed on top of me. It was such a gratifying feeling.\n\nMaybe I would have become a slut either way but  I do wish it could have happened differently",
