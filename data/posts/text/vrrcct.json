  "title": "My [F24] experience being a ‘live-in slave’ for my Daddy [M64]",
  "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I’d like to note, as disclaimer, is I’m mostly talking about events that happened a years ago, I’ve tried to give those juicy “details” I know ya’ll love, but I’m sure, knowing how memory works, I’ll be mixing up one or two things. While I have quotes in here, it’s mostly how I remember things happening. I don’t actually remember, word-for-word, what Daddy said to me but I know how he talks and remember the jist of what he said and have reconstructed form there. I’m putting this here as a kinda “I’m human, with a human memory memory”. Don’t get too mad if feel my story telling is clumsy.\n\n—\n\nSo, to get it out the way, I’ve always preferred older men sexually.I prefer 50 or 60 year olds ideally. People have asked me why, and I don’t have a good answer. They just turn me on. I have “Daddy Issues” lol. I feel more relaxed around an older man. Like with a young guy I’ve got to be someone I’m not, while with an older guy I can be more uninhibited. That’s all I can say.\n\nAnother thing I’ve always liked is “being used”. That’s my word for it. I mean, I love just being a sex object. Being used for sex and nothing more. A “cumbucket”, a “slut”. I’ve always been this way. It’s always been my fantasy and what I want.\n\nSo, I like being used my older men. That’s me. That’s my sex desires summed up!\n\nLike most I kept my filthy desires to myself mostly. I only acted on them out with partners who’d indulge me but they’d always be strings attached. Like, I’d date someone and let them know, but it’s weird to be used by someone you’re dating because they are are also trying to build a connection with you. How do I go from being sex object to being romanced? So it never really worked\n\nWith that unscratched itch I’d go chat online to guys. I used to frequent chatiw. It’s actually a very crappy chat app which I wouldn’t recommend (people on there are just “off” and if you’re a girl you’re overwhelmed with people asking you for pics or just being weird). Either way, I spent a lot of time there when I was bored, especially during the pandemic. Sometimes I’d just go on to talk with familiar faces.\n\nOne day, about August 2020 I get a message from a guy. As a start it was all standard. I knew the procedure. Lots of sex talk, sharing experiences, them begging for pics, me withholding because I don’t feel comfortable, etc. For whatever reason, this guy stuck. I enjoyed his chat. He was 62 at the time and I was 22. He’d never married but had had some GFs. He was retired and was living his best life in SoCal (not crazy far as I live in NorCAl). He had a nice house with a pool and hot tub (which I thought was , and still think is, living like a king). He was fit for his age, worked out and ran regularly. A little belly but not what I’d think of as fat. Thick hair on his chest. Good masculine face with a full head of grayed hair. White., 5 foot 10” tall. He had a big cut dick, 7 inches when erect and a noticeable thickness to it, even when flacid. For me, he was great. He told me to call him “Daddy”. I do know his real name, but that’s all I’ve ever called him.\n\nHe explained to me his need for a “slave”. He wanted someone to live in with him and own. Someone to use however he wanted. This excited me and we kept talking, eventually taking it into private phone chat apps.\n\nFor a week or so it was just horny chat. We’d traded fantasies, pics, and vids. Eventually we called, and FaceTimed. We matched well in terms of what we wanted but I made it clear I didn’t want to be a “slave” for real. It was a fantasy but I wanted my own life most of the time.\n\nIt being the pandemic, we both had more time on our hands than we knew what to do with, and we spent it talking and playing sexy games. The biggest one was I gave him control over my orgasms. I promised if he sent me a text asking me to orgasm, I’d drop what I was doing and do it. Naturally, he’d try to wear me out with it at all times, sometimes one right after another. Sometimes I’d tell him I can’t because I was tired or I’d ignore his messages, and he’d get frustrated. Naturally, from afar, he had no real control. You know how it is, you don’t want to play sex games and you can get away with avoiding them.\n\nThe pandemic kept going and we kept talking. Eventually we agreed that when things started to open up again, we’d meet. I’d fly to him for a few days and during that time I’d be his slave.\n\nOver time rules developed for this meet we were planning. These were never really written down but were developed over time and just mutually understood. Basically they were:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I’d be naked at all times at his home.\n2. It’d just be him and me there. No guests \\[see the end of this post for an update on this\\].\n3. He’d not do anything to cause damage or anything that could endanger me, but stuff that caused pain like slapping and stretching was ok and I’d just need to put up with it.\n4. No Shit (piss was ok though).\n5. While I was there, my body would be his to use assuming the other rules were respected.\n6. I’d follow his orders though I’d be forced if they weren’t followed anyway.\n7. When he didn’t need me I could do as I pleased. Watch TV, enjoy the pool and hot tub, anything, but I’d need to stop when he wanted me.\n8. I could use my phone but it couldn’t get in the way of anything he wanted. I had to promise to not reveal what was happening to friends and family.\n9. I’d address him as “Daddy” (I already did anyway, but it’d be the same in person).\n10. If at any point I wanted to leave I was to say “I want to go to the hotel”. At this point, everything would stop. I’d get my clothes back on, and he’d drive me to a hotel and pay for me to stay there without him until my return flight. They’d be no shame in this, he would not debate it and would respect it. That’d be it.\n\nRule 10 was the most important. I had worried how best to marry my desire of being used while also having an opt out in case, well, I needed to. Like most into this, I want my calls for “No” to be overridden…. There’s a fun in it. Yet, understandably, guys don’t want the rape charge on their record when things go wrong. This rule was perfect. I could always leave but, as he put it it “it’s an all or nothing deal”. I was either his slave 100% or I’d leave. I couldn’t pick and choose how I served him. My choice was what he wanted, or a hotel without him. That was the extent of my freedom\n\nThis rule seemed F-Upped a bit at first, but, over time I’ve come to realize it’s just a safe word (or phrase in this case). And when I say it, he stops. Unlike most safe words, there’s ingenious incentive not to say it. I can’t just say it because I’m uncomfortable or don’t want to do something. I can only say it when I literally need to go home. It’s really the last resort.\n\nWe agreed a week would be a good period of time. I’d fly to SoCal on Monday and leave Sunday, and see how it goes. He agreed to pay for my flight which I appreciated.\n\nDue to the pandemic (waiting for our vaccines), my schooling, and just not finding the right time that worked for both us, we ended up meeting in June of 2021. We’d kept in contact, naturally. By this time I knew him very well, especially how demanding he was.\n\nThe time came and I flew down. I told my parents I was going on a trip with friends (renting a place with a pool and having a college summer break), and told my friends I was vacationing with my parents. It worked. No one batted an eye. I left a note hidden in my bedroom drawer explaining exactly what I was doing just in case. I know I’m messed up but I wanted my parents to know what happened if it did all turn out to be a serial killers trap! (Spoiler: I’m alive and well and the letter was never found!).\n\nHe picked me up from the airport. When we were in the car I confess I felt a little weird. I had assumed I’d be relaxed but things in person felt a little off. Like, someone I’d only seen remotely was now right next to me. I wondered if I should just get out there and then.\n\nAfter some short back-and-forth ‘how are you?; Nice flight?’ conversation (that did not flow easily) there was a pause and he reached over and began to grope me through my pants. I then reached over and started to tug at him through his. I remember at that moment I no longer felt weird, like some ice had been broken. On the car ride back he told me to drop my pants a little and play with myself while reaching over and fondling him a bit. I did. I don’t know if anyone saw but I was thrilled to think any car that passed us might get a peek, especially as we got into slower residential streets.\n\nWhen we parked at his place, I pulled up my pants and went inside with him and my suitcase (the suitcase was just full of clothes in case I needed the hotel, everything else for me was provided by him). His place was great. I’d seen it though video chat before but it looked better in person. When I got in the door he took my suitcase and said “get naked and I’ll put this all away for the week”. Of course, he’d seen me naked before and I felt no shame in quickly getting undressed. He took my clothes with my suitcase and threw them deep into a cupboard. I knew I’d only see them again when I left.\n\nHe then approached me and said “it starts now”. He then, without missing a second of time began squeezing my left boob uncomfortably hard. I winced and he said “Oh, so sensitive” sarcastically as he tortured me a bit with it. Then he stopped and took his clothes off. I waited for him. I remember so strongly at this time, feeling the residual pain in my boob, and knowing he was about to use me. There was just one phrase running through my head: “What have I done?”. I’m sure anyone with a fetish knows this. The feeling that maybe this fantasy should have just remained a fantasy, and maybe the reality is… just not fun. With this feeling inside me he looked at me and commanded “Get sucking”. I got my to knees as requested and took him in my mouth, pushing those thoughts of doubt aside.\n\nI know what he’s like. When he’s not came in a while (like…. Hours) he wants rough and fast. He wants to get out that easy load, and saves longer session for after. Not long after sucking him he grabbed my head and started to facefuck me. As I’ve come to expect from him, there was no holding back. He was on a mission. I struggled to take him being this forceful but when I instinctively raised my hand he slapped it away. The message was clear. I gagged and chocked. I was fortunate not to puke, but I felt I might for a while. I don’t know how long this lasted, there, in the hallway, but eventually he came deep down my throat as I gagged on his dick. We’d talked about this moment for so long. The first act. I could’ve predicted exactly what he would do but it was still intense for me. His first load in me after 10 months of talking. Then he pulled back. He told me to turn around and look at myself in a mirror that was hanging from a closet door. There I was naked, with fluids of all kinds over my face, makeup running, my hair a mess. I really did look like the final frame in a hardcore porno…\n\nAfter this we went to the bedroom. He’d always told me he was someone “blessed with a high drive”. Guys have told me stuff like this before but few delivered. He did. He told me when we first started talking he cums “4 times a day minimum” and at the time I found that crazy high until I got to know him and realized this was true and really only the tip of the iceberg. With me there, I knew it’d be higher. He warned me it may feel non-stop.\n\nHe then lay back on the bed and asked me to suck him until hard again. That didn’t take long. Then he demanded I ride him, which I did as he lay back and relaxed. Anyone who’s done it knows, riding can be exhausting, and I felt that exhaustion after a while. He could see it in my face and said “it’ll be worse if you stop, work that dick”. I did. Eventually he tells me it’s time for my ass. I wasn’t surprised. He knew he could and I knew he’d want to use all holes on the first day, just to try them. I’d been training with my toys on his request. Anal was hard for me. Never comfortable, always some pain. He warned me he “just spits” for lube so…\n\nHe spat his hand and rubbed his dick, then did so again to reach into my ass and finger it. It still felt so dry, but it’s all I was getting. Then I went and mounted him. For me, the first insertion is always so painful. Every cell in my body wants to back out. It’s like pushing sandpaper up there. But with my toys, I had learned to just endure this and it’d get better. Thankfully he was laying down so I had some control. It was painful, somehow more so than when I had practiced at home, but I grinned and did it.When I reached the base he grabbed my hips and started humping me, enjoying my discomfort. However, I did not let that discomfort stop me from riding and doing my best.\n\nAfter some of this he flipped me and went in my ass with my face down on the bed. While I was face-down he went at me hard and fast and regularly slapped my ass while calling me every name under the sun. Then, he came.\n\nI lay in bed with him for a moment. I asked if he was satisfied and he simply said “yes. I’m going to lay here and relax a bit, you put your head between my legs and suck on me gently”. I did. I do not exaggerate to say I was there for over an hour. Taking his dick gently in my mouth. It got hard eventually but he just liked it as a massage. He clearly wasn’t horny enough to want to cum, but enjoyed the gentle sensation as he just lay in bed and closed his eyes; almost like a nap. At some point I’m getting tired and he begins to move. I assume that meant he’s done but he says “I’m going to piss in your mouth ok? It’ll be a slow release and I don’t want you to drop any. You swallow ok?Learn fast”.\n\nMy experience of piss being minimal outside of his games of me drinking some of my own (yip…), I was worried. It was about as pleasant as you can imagine, and the slow stream seemed to last forever. Finally he was done.\n\nBy this point it was late and he told me I was free to explore the house for a bit. I did. I got in the pool and hottub. It was luxury. As I’m walking around the living room enjoying the place he comes up to me and without warning slaps me across the face. I’m shocked. Going from tranquil to pain like that took me off guard. I look at him with fear as I rub my face. He smiles and says “You’re wondering why I did that?”, and I respond ‘yeah… did I do something wrong?”. He then replied “No, I did it because I felt like it. You agree I can?”. Then his wicked smile widened and I responded, simply “yes”. He then commanded I orgasm 3 times for him, right there. I did and he fucked me again, giving me his third load before we both went to bed, concluding our first day together.\n\nOver the next day things kept going at that pace. The days begin to merge in my memory but I’d be awoke, sometimes in the middle of the night, to his urges, and I’d do whatever he needed. He’d cum multiple times a day and often just enjoy me sucking him for hours on end. There was plenty of piss and he’d enjoy seeing me in pain so that was always a point for him. Slapping, squeezing, man handling me. In the down-time I’d enjoy myself as if at a luxury hotel but sooner or later he’d need me. I’d guess on average I took take 7 loads a day. At least, he orgasmsed about that much, sometimes the loads were pretty dry. Sometimes I’d work a few out in one session. I know that sounds high… but that’s just how he is.\n\nI remember by the time day three came around I was tired, and I felt like maybe I was no longer enjoying my life there. In a sense, why would I be enjoying it at all? I was just his slave. I was used by him as he wanted. That led to the the first time I told him “no”. I remember he pushed me down to suck his dick but I was tired after a day of service. I pushed his arm away and said “no, not now” firmly. Even though we had discussed it, I was somehow shocked by how little he cared about this. I guess I had assumed he was bluffing a bit, somehow, about not accepting no for an answer, but he was not. In fact, he seemed to enjoy the rebellion. All he did was grab my head and force me onto the dick. As I struggled away he facefucked me. He didn’t cum and released me when he had had his fun. He then said “I didn’t say it’d be easy. I know what I want”. I then answered that I just didn’t want to right now, that I needed a break. He then said something that stuck with me “This is real-life now. You can’t just ignore your texts or make an excuse.You know how to get out of this but that means leaving here for good. You can do that, or you can stay. It’s up to you. I’m either going to get everything the way I want it or nothing”. That rule again… He looked at me waiting for a response. I agonized. Short-term me wanted to leave. The idea of a quiet hotel where I could rest felt good but I felt, somehow, I’d live to regret doing that… that I needed to see this through. I then responded that I was sorry and asked if he needed anything with defeat in my tired voice. He then said “we’ll continue to play, I’m still hard, and tonight, you will suck my dick gently as I sleep. You will not stop until I say. It could well be all night. This is how you’re going to prove yourself back to me. Learn to deal with a life without ‘No’ and serve ”. So, I did do that for him. After our rough exhausting play, I sucked him gently for 5 hours. Him falling in and out of sleep as I gently nursed his cock. 5 hellish hours where I just wanted to rest. Eventually grabbed my head and lifted me up. “Enough” he said. I got about an two hours sleep before starting the next day.\n\nThings became even more of a blur but, also, I feel like I started to adapt after my little breakdown. I was always tired and took naps when I wasn’t needed but Often awoken by him wanting something. We’d snack more than eat, and I’d lay by the pool on downtime. I did exercises when I could to not become too much of a couch potato. When he didn’t need me, when he was satisfied, he’d go about little things like watch TV or browse the web. He had some hobbies he’d attend to and did some work outs on his equipment. I asked him what he did with all his free time and he told me that this was pretty much it minus me being here. He told me he’d just jerk it a lot more. He then told me he deserved a slave and that me being one for him gave me purpose. This made me so horny despite all the sex and exhaustion. I asked him more about my “purpose” and he explained that I was meant to do this, that I was born to serve men. He unravelled this whole philosophy about how men were made to spread seed and women made to accept it. That men were not living authentically by restraining themselves and women should serve. He explained he had these desires for a reason and he was right to act on them. Cum was life bringing, and sexual desire is what spread it. All our lives came from it. He said how we were living was “the way it was meant to be”. In that state at time, being sleep deprived and used like crazy, I felt this was all very profound (despite it clearly just being the ramblings of a horn-dog). It turned me on and kept me going for the rest of the day. I think part of me believed him. I think part still might.\n\nAs the week went on, we did everything, and I felt everything. Someone cumming in me used to be a somewhat rare thing but by a point it felt as ordinary as drinking water. You just lose count. You stop even remembering what the last thing was. Just focused on the here and now. He used me as his urinal whenever it was easier than doing so elsewhere. I sometimes spilled a little, and he’d slap me hard and make me lick it up. I learned to just zone out when I gave him extended sucking, which he liked when he was relaxing (typically watching tv or on his computer), I don’t know how to explain it. I just got in a rhythm and somehow the time passed. Hours. Sometimes I’ll realize what I’m doing, like “Oh shit, I’m sucking, how long’s it been?”. The only change in the fact would be as as he stiffens up to cum in me. Didn’t take me long to know exactly what to do to push all the buttons. He’d still use my throat and sometimes I’d vomit a bit but he seemed to like this mess. Proud of it basically. Pain was always, well, painful, but every so often I’d look and see how happy it made him to see me squirm and such and… like, I felt I was doing a good job sometimes. My ass got used to things and my pussy was filled and was requested to regularly cum.\n\nThere were, of course, several points when I wanted to quit but I always moved forwards. I kept thinking about my “purpose” to him. He mentioned that purpose was something that gave your life meaning, but it didn’t mean it was always easy. Damn… he knew how to get in my head and when I’d satisfied him, I felt good about myself too. He wasn’t big on rewards, as you can imagine, but he wanted pleasure and he got pleasure whenever he wanted. It was a lot of work, but it was all me. My life was completely devoted to one mans sexual needs during that time. That was it. That was me. Every whim. He told me once that he’d take everything from me just for one more second of pleasure… That if me staying up all night meant he got a little more happiness, he’d make me stay up all night. I respected that. I told him I wanted a daddy who puts his pleasure first and he was that. I asked him once if this week was what he wanted and he said “yes, you’re enabling me to have the life I deserve.”… I was so proud of myself.\n\nEventually the time came to leave. I got clothed and he drove me to the airport. There was no grand farewell. He said he was disappointed it was over but that was it. When I got back to NorCal we kept talking and by January of this year I was already back for 5 days (all I could do with school). I’ve already spoken enough but as you can imagine it was basically the same deal as before. I’m going to head down in the middle of next month too for a full week. I hope to keep this going at this frequency.\n\nAt this stage, I consider it my vacation, all expenses paid. It’s my way to let this side of me out. It’s a way to enjoy my sex life and my unusual kinks. He’s talked to me about me moving in on a permanent basis with him after I’m done with college but I’ve always declined. Doing this as a vacation is great but full-time… it’s totally different. He does want this to happen and has given me a lot of offers (“time off” to build a career, rest days, and, yes, marry him for his inheritance once I’ve served him to the end! (I’m really not joking here, he’s telling the truth)) but, personally, I need these things to have an end date for the foreseeable future. Who knows how I’ll feel going forward. I don’t want to burn any bridges, but, for now, this is enough. He jokes I’ll come crawling to him for slavery once the “real world” crushes me ;P.\n\nThe only thing we’re going to change when I visit next month is we’re scrapping the “No guests” rule. This was a rule he’d put down to put me early on to put us both at ease as I’d said I’d only feel comfortable serving one guy. But, things have changed. He’s talked about me with some of his friends and they want to come visit and play. So, yes, I’m going to accept guests. The rule here is they are to be treated with the same way as Daddy. If serving a guest and serving Daddy are in conflict, I serve Daddy. Like all things with him, this scares me but turns me on in equal measure. I can’t wait to see what happens. He won’t tell me what they are like or what they might do. Just to expect them to come visit.\n\nI’ve shared this part of me with people I know online, and two really close friends IRL, but that’s it. Most don’t understand why I’d do something like this. My two friends have a “don’t kink shame” mindset to me and that’s about it. Even with all this space, I do not know how to explain it well to those who don’t feel the way I do. Rationally, my actions make no sense. Though looking over some subreddits, I think you people get me, and some writings here inspired me to post. I really hope I turned some of you on too, honestly.\n\nThank you.\n\n——\n\nFinally some housekeeping information stuff for internet pervs who i’ve come to post something online. Consider reading this before DMing me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. No I’m not looking for a new daddy right now.\n2. I’m not looking to meet from here. Period.\n3. Sorry, I don’t trade pics, sorry. I’m white, short light-brown hair, 5 foot 6. That’s all I’ll let you know ;P. Go look at some porn.\n4. Yes I’m single but not looking for a relationship right now. Daddy isn’t by BF, and I would like one of those at some point. I don’t know what a good BF would be for me. Perhaps Just one that allowed these trips? I don’t know. As I said, I’m not looking for one right now.\n5. Yes, I’m a woman. You can believe me or not. I don’t care.\n6. Stop asking when I first took dick. It’s gross. The answer is 18 but I know what you’re getting at.\n7. I don’t have any other daddies or guys who treat me like this. It’s just my trips to see Daddy for now. I’m fine with that.",

While I have quotes in here, it’s mostly how I remember things happening. I don’t actually remember, word-for-word, what Daddy said to me but I know how he talks and remember the jist of what he said and have reconstructed form there. I’m putting this here as a kinda “I’m human, with a human memory memory”. Don’t get too mad if feel my story telling is clumsy.\n\n—\n\nSo, to get it out the way, I’ve always preferred older men sexually.I prefer 50 or 60 year olds ideally. People have asked me why, and I don’t have a good answer. They just turn me on. I have “Daddy Issues” lol. I feel more relaxed around an older man. Like with a young guy I’ve got to be someone I’m not, while with an older guy I can be more uninhibited. That’s all I can say.\n\nAnother thing I’ve always liked is “being used”. That’s my word for it. I mean, I love just being a sex object. Being used for sex and nothing more. A “cumbucket”, a “slut”. I’ve always been this way. It’s always been my fantasy and what I want.\n\nSo, I like being used my older men. That’s me. That’s my sex desires summed up!\n\nLike most I kept my filthy desires to myself mostly. I only acted on them out with partners who’d indulge me but they’d always be strings attached. Like, I’d date someone and let them know, but it’s weird to be used by someone you’re dating because they are are also trying to build a connection with you. How do I go from being sex object to being romanced? So it never really worked\n\nWith that unscratched itch I’d go chat online to guys. I used to frequent chatiw. It’s actually a very crappy chat app which I wouldn’t recommend (people on there are just “off” and if you’re a girl you’re overwhelmed with people asking you for pics or just being weird). Either way, I spent a lot of time there when I was bored, especially during the pandemic. Sometimes I’d just go on to talk with familiar faces.\n\nOne day, about August 2020 I get a message from a guy. As a start it was all standard. I knew the procedure. Lots of sex talk, sharing experiences, them begging for pics, me withholding because I don’t feel comfortable, etc. For whatever reason, this guy stuck. I enjoyed his chat. He was 62 at the time and I was 22. He’d never married but had had some GFs. He was retired and was living his best life in SoCal (not crazy far as I live in NorCAl). He had a nice house with a pool and hot tub (which I thought was , and still think is, living like a king). He was fit for his age, worked out and ran regularly. A little belly but not what I’d think of as fat. Thick hair on his chest. Good masculine face with a full head of grayed hair. White., 5 foot 10” tall. He had a big cut dick, 7 inches when erect and a noticeable thickness to it, even when flacid. For me, he was great. He told me to call him “Daddy”. I do know his real name, but that’s all I’ve ever called him.\n\nHe explained to me his need for a “slave”. He wanted someone to live in with him and own. Someone to use however he wanted. This excited me and we kept talking, eventually taking it into private phone chat apps.\n\nFor a week or so it was just horny chat. We’d traded fantasies, pics, and vids. Eventually we called, and FaceTimed. We matched well in terms of what we wanted but I made it clear I didn’t want to be a “slave” for real. It was a fantasy but I wanted my own life most of the time.\n\nIt being the pandemic, we both had more time on our hands than we knew what to do with, and we spent it talking and playing sexy games. The biggest one was I gave him control over my orgasms. I promised if he sent me a text asking me to orgasm, I’d drop what I was doing and do it. Naturally, he’d try to wear me out with it at all times, sometimes one right after another. Sometimes I’d tell him I can’t because I was tired or I’d ignore his messages, and he’d get frustrated. Naturally, from afar, he had no real control. You know how it is, you don’t want to play sex games and you can get away with avoiding them.\n\nThe pandemic kept going and we kept talking. Eventually we agreed that when things started to open up again, we’d meet. I’d fly to him for a few days and during that time I’d be his slave.\n\nOver time rules developed for this meet we were planning. These were never really written down but were developed over time and just mutually understood. Basically they were:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I’d be naked at all times at his home.\n2. It’d just be him and me there. No guests \\[see the end of this post for an update on this\\].\n3. He’d not do anything to cause damage or anything that could endanger me, but stuff that caused pain like slapping and stretching was ok and I’d just need to put up with it.\n4. No Shit (piss was ok though).\n5. While I was there, my body would be his to use assuming the other rules were respected.\n6. I’d follow his orders though I’d be forced if they weren’t followed anyway.\n7. When he didn’t need me I could do as I pleased. Watch TV, enjoy the pool and hot tub, anything, but I’d need to stop when he wanted me.\n8. I could use my phone but it couldn’t get in the way of anything he wanted. I had to promise to not reveal what was happening to friends and family.\n9. I’d address him as “Daddy” (I already did anyway, but it’d be the same in person).\n10. If at any point I wanted to leave I was to say “I want to go to the hotel”. At this point, everything would stop. I’d get my clothes back on, and he’d drive me to a hotel and pay for me to stay there without him until my return flight. They’d be no shame in this, he would not debate it and would respect it. That’d be it.\n\nRule 10 was the most important. I had worried how best to marry my desire of being used while also having an opt out in case, well, I needed to. Like most into this, I want my calls for “No” to be overridden…. There’s a fun in it. Yet, understandably, guys don’t want the rape charge on their record when things go wrong. This rule was perfect. I could always leave but, as he put it it “it’s an all or nothing deal”. I was either his slave 100% or I’d leave. I couldn’t pick and choose how I served him. My choice was what he wanted, or a hotel without him. That was the extent of my freedom\n\nThis rule seemed F-Upped a bit at first, but, over time I’ve come to realize it’s just a safe word (or phrase in this case). And when I say it, he stops. Unlike most safe words, there’s ingenious incentive not to say it. I can’t just say it because I’m uncomfortable or don’t want to do something. I can only say it when I literally need to go home. It’s really the last resort.\n\nWe agreed a week would be a good period of time. I’d fly to SoCal on Monday and leave Sunday, and see how it goes. He agreed to pay for my flight which I appreciated.\n\nDue to the pandemic (waiting for our vaccines), my schooling, and just not finding the right time that worked for both us, we ended up meeting in June of 2021. We’d kept in contact, naturally. By this time I knew him very well, especially how demanding he was.\n\nThe time came and I flew down. I told my parents I was going on a trip with friends (renting a place with a pool and having a college summer break), and told my friends I was vacationing with my parents. It worked. No one batted an eye. I left a note hidden in my bedroom drawer explaining exactly what I was doing just in case. I know I’m messed up but I wanted my parents to know what happened if it did all turn out to be a serial killers trap! (Spoiler: I’m alive and well and the letter was never found!).\n\nHe picked me up from the airport. When we were in the car I confess I felt a little weird. I had assumed I’d be relaxed but things in person felt a little off. Like, someone I’d only seen remotely was now right next to me. I wondered if I should just get out there and then.\n\nAfter some short back-and-forth ‘how are you?; Nice flight?’ conversation (that did not flow easily) there was a pause and he reached over and began to grope me through my pants. I then reached over and started to tug at him through his. I remember at that moment I no longer felt weird, like some ice had been broken. On the car ride back he told me to drop my pants a little and play with myself while reaching over and fondling him a bit. I did. I don’t know if anyone saw but I was thrilled to think any car that passed us might get a peek, especially as we got into slower residential streets.\n\nWhen we parked at his place, I pulled up my pants and went inside with him and my suitcase (the suitcase was just full of clothes in case I needed the hotel, everything else for me was provided by him). His place was great. I’d seen it though video chat before but it looked better in person. When I got in the door he took my suitcase and said “get naked and I’ll put this all away for the week”. Of course, he’d seen me naked before and I felt no shame in quickly getting undressed. He took my clothes with my suitcase and threw them deep into a cupboard. I knew I’d only see them again when I left.\n\nHe then approached me and said “it starts now”. He then, without missing a second of time began squeezing my left boob uncomfortably hard. I winced and he said “Oh, so sensitive” sarcastically as he tortured me a bit with it. Then he stopped and took his clothes off. I waited for him. I remember so strongly at this time, feeling the residual pain in my boob, and knowing he was about to use me. There was just one phrase running through my head: “What have I done?”. I’m sure anyone with a fetish knows this. The feeling that maybe this fantasy should have just remained a fantasy, and maybe the reality is… just not fun. With this feeling inside me he looked at me and commanded “Get sucking”. I got my to knees as requested and took him in my mouth, pushing those thoughts of doubt aside.\n\nI know what he’s like. When he’s not came in a while (like…. Hours) he wants rough and fast. He wants to get out that easy load, and saves longer session for after. Not long after sucking him he grabbed my head and started to facefuck me. As I’ve come to expect from him, there was no holding back. He was on a mission. I struggled to take him being this forceful but when I instinctively raised my hand he slapped it away. The message was clear. I gagged and chocked. I was fortunate not to puke, but I felt I might for a while. I don’t know how long this lasted, there, in the hallway, but eventually he came deep down my throat as I gagged on his dick. We’d talked about this moment for so long. The first act. I could’ve predicted exactly what he would do but it was still intense for me. His first load in me after 10 months of talking. Then he pulled back. He told me to turn around and look at myself in a mirror that was hanging from a closet door. There I was naked, with fluids of all kinds over my face, makeup running, my hair a mess. I really did look like the final frame in a hardcore porno…\n\nAfter this we went to the bedroom. He’d always told me he was someone “blessed with a high drive”. Guys have told me stuff like this before but few delivered. He did. He told me when we first started talking he cums “4 times a day minimum” and at the time I found that crazy high until I got to know him and realized this was true and really only the tip of the iceberg. With me there, I knew it’d be higher. He warned me it may feel non-stop.\n\nHe then lay back on the bed and asked me to suck him until hard again. That didn’t take long. Then he demanded I ride him, which I did as he lay back and relaxed. Anyone who’s done it knows, riding can be exhausting, and I felt that exhaustion after a while. He could see it in my face and said “it’ll be worse if you stop, work that dick”. I did. Eventually he tells me it’s time for my ass. I wasn’t surprised. He knew he could and I knew he’d want to use all holes on the first day, just to try them. I’d been training with my toys on his request. Anal was hard for me. Never comfortable, always some pain. He warned me he “just spits” for lube so…\n\nHe spat his hand and rubbed his dick, then did so again to reach into my ass and finger it. It still felt so dry, but it’s all I was getting. Then I went and mounted him. For me, the first insertion is always so painful. Every cell in my body wants to back out. It’s like pushing sandpaper up there. But with my toys, I had learned to just endure this and it’d get better. Thankfully he was laying down so I had some control. It was painful, somehow more so than when I had practiced at home, but I grinned and did it.When I reached the base he grabbed my hips and started humping me, enjoying my discomfort. However, I did not let that discomfort stop me from riding and doing my best.\n\nAfter some of this he flipped me and went in my ass with my face down on the bed. While I was face-down he went at me hard and fast and regularly slapped my ass while calling me every name under the sun. Then, he came.\n\nI lay in bed with him for a moment. I asked if he was satisfied and he simply said “yes. I’m going to lay here and relax a bit, you put your head between my legs and suck on me gently”. I did. I do not exaggerate to say I was there for over an hour. Taking his dick gently in my mouth. It got hard eventually but he just liked it as a massage. He clearly wasn’t horny enough to want to cum, but enjoyed the gentle sensation as he just lay in bed and closed his eyes; almost like a nap. At some point I’m getting tired and he begins to move. I assume that meant he’s done but he says “I’m going to piss in your mouth ok? It’ll be a slow release and I don’t want you to drop any. You swallow ok?Learn fast”.\n\nMy experience of piss being minimal outside of his games of me drinking some of my own (yip…), I was worried. It was about as pleasant as you can imagine, and the slow stream seemed to last forever. Finally he was done.\n\nBy this point it was late and he told me I was free to explore the house for a bit. I did. I got in the pool and hottub. It was luxury. As I’m walking around the living room enjoying the place he comes up to me and without warning slaps me across the face. I’m shocked. Going from tranquil to pain like that took me off guard. I look at him with fear as I rub my face. He smiles and says “You’re wondering why I did that?”, and I respond ‘yeah… did I do something wrong?”. He then replied “No, I did it because I felt like it. You agree I can?”. Then his wicked smile widened and I responded, simply “yes”. He then commanded I orgasm 3 times for him, right there. I did and he fucked me again, giving me his third load before we both went to bed, concluding our first day together.\n\nOver the next day things kept going at that pace. The days begin to merge in my memory but I’d be awoke, sometimes in the middle of the night, to his urges, and I’d do whatever he needed. He’d cum multiple times a day and often just enjoy me sucking him for hours on end. There was plenty of piss and he’d enjoy seeing me in pain so that was always a point for him. Slapping, squeezing, man handling me. In the down-time I’d enjoy myself as if at a luxury hotel but sooner or later he’d need me. I’d guess on average I took take 7 loads a day. At least, he orgasmsed about that much, sometimes the loads were pretty dry. Sometimes I’d work a few out in one session. I know that sounds high… but that’s just how he is.\n\nI remember by the time day three came around I was tired, and I felt like maybe I was no longer enjoying my life there. In a sense, why would I be enjoying it at all? I was just his slave. I was used by him as he wanted. That led to the the first time I told him “no”. I remember he pushed me down to suck his dick but I was tired after a day of service. I pushed his arm away and said “no, not now” firmly. Even though we had discussed it, I was somehow shocked by how little he cared about this. I guess I had assumed he was bluffing a bit, somehow, about not accepting no for an answer, but he was not. In fact, he seemed to enjoy the rebellion. All he did was grab my head and force me onto the dick. As I struggled away he facefucked me. He didn’t cum and released me when he had had his fun. He then said “I didn’t say it’d be easy. I know what I want”. I then answered that I just didn’t want to right now, that I needed a break. He then said something that stuck with me “This is real-life now. You can’t just ignore your texts or make an excuse.You know how to get out of this but that means leaving here for good. You can do that, or you can stay. It’s up to you. I’m either going to get everything the way I want it or nothing”. That rule again… He looked at me waiting for a response. I agonized. Short-term me wanted to leave. The idea of a quiet hotel where I could rest felt good but I felt, somehow, I’d live to regret doing that… that I needed to see this through. I then responded that I was sorry and asked if he needed anything with defeat in my tired voice. He then said “we’ll continue to play, I’m still hard, and tonight, you will suck my dick gently as I sleep. You will not stop until I say. It could well be all night. This is how you’re going to prove yourself back to me. Learn to deal with a life without ‘No’ and serve ”. So, I did do that for him. After our rough exhausting play, I sucked him gently for 5 hours. Him falling in and out of sleep as I gently nursed his cock. 5 hellish hours where I just wanted to rest. Eventually grabbed my head and lifted me up. “Enough” he said. I got about an two hours sleep before starting the next day.\n\nThings became even more of a blur but, also, I feel like I started to adapt after my little breakdown. I was always tired and took naps when I wasn’t needed but Often awoken by him wanting something. We’d snack more than eat, and I’d lay by the pool on downtime. I did exercises when I could to not become too much of a couch potato. When he didn’t need me, when he was satisfied, he’d go about little things like watch TV or browse the web. He had some hobbies he’d attend to and did some work outs on his equipment. I asked him what he did with all his free time and he told me that this was pretty much it minus me being here. He told me he’d just jerk it a lot more. He then told me he deserved a slave and that me being one for him gave me purpose. This made me so horny despite all the sex and exhaustion. I asked him more about my “purpose” and he explained that I was meant to do this, that I was born to serve men. He unravelled this whole philosophy about how men were made to spread seed and women made to accept it. That men were not living authentically by restraining themselves and women should serve. He explained he had these desires for a reason and he was right to act on them. Cum was life bringing, and sexual desire is what spread it. All our lives came from it. He said how we were living was “the way it was meant to be”. In that state at time, being sleep deprived and used like crazy, I felt this was all very profound (despite it clearly just being the ramblings of a horn-dog). It turned me on and kept me going for the rest of the day. I think part of me believed him. I think part still might.\n\nAs the week went on, we did everything, and I felt everything. Someone cumming in me used to be a somewhat rare thing but by a point it felt as ordinary as drinking water. You just lose count. You stop even remembering what the last thing was. Just focused on the here and now. He used me as his urinal whenever it was easier than doing so elsewhere. I sometimes spilled a little, and he’d slap me hard and make me lick it up. I learned to just zone out when I gave him extended sucking, which he liked when he was relaxing (typically watching tv or on his computer), I don’t know how to explain it. I just got in a rhythm and somehow the time passed. Hours. Sometimes I’ll realize what I’m doing, like “Oh shit, I’m sucking, how long’s it been?”. The only change in the fact would be as as he stiffens up to cum in me. Didn’t take me long to know exactly what to do to push all the buttons. He’d still use my throat and sometimes I’d vomit a bit but he seemed to like this mess. Proud of it basically. Pain was always, well, painful, but every so often I’d look and see how happy it made him to see me squirm and such and… like, I felt I was doing a good job sometimes. My ass got used to things and my pussy was filled and was requested to regularly cum.\n\nThere were, of course, several points when I wanted to quit but I always moved forwards. I kept thinking about my “purpose” to him. He mentioned that purpose was something that gave your life meaning, but it didn’t mean it was always easy. Damn… he knew how to get in my head and when I’d satisfied him, I felt good about myself too. He wasn’t big on rewards, as you can imagine, but he wanted pleasure and he got pleasure whenever he wanted. It was a lot of work, but it was all me. My life was completely devoted to one mans sexual needs during that time. That was it. That was me. Every whim. He told me once that he’d take everything from me just for one more second of pleasure… That if me staying up all night meant he got a little more happiness, he’d make me stay up all night. I respected that. I told him I wanted a daddy who puts his pleasure first and he was that. I asked him once if this week was what he wanted and he said “yes, you’re enabling me to have the life I deserve.”… I was so proud of myself.\n\nEventually the time came to leave. I got clothed and he drove me to the airport. There was no grand farewell. He said he was disappointed it was over but that was it. When I got back to NorCal we kept talking and by January of this year I was already back for 5 days (all I could do with school). I’ve already spoken enough but as you can imagine it was basically the same deal as before. I’m going to head down in the middle of next month too for a full week. I hope to keep this going at this frequency.\n\nAt this stage, I consider it my vacation, all expenses paid. It’s my way to let this side of me out. It’s a way to enjoy my sex life and my unusual kinks. He’s talked to me about me moving in on a permanent basis with him after I’m done with college but I’ve always declined. Doing this as a vacation is great but full-time… it’s totally different. He does want this to happen and has given me a lot of offers (“time off” to build a career, rest days, and, yes, marry him for his inheritance once I’ve served him to the end! (I’m really not joking here, he’s telling the truth)) but, personally, I need these things to have an end date for the foreseeable future. Who knows how I’ll feel going forward. I don’t want to burn any bridges, but, for now, this is enough. He jokes I’ll come crawling to him for slavery once the “real world” crushes me ;P.\n\nThe only thing we’re going to change when I visit next month is we’re scrapping the “No guests” rule. This was a rule he’d put down to put me early on to put us both at ease as I’d said I’d only feel comfortable serving one guy. But, things have changed. He’s talked about me with some of his friends and they want to come visit and play. So, yes, I’m going to accept guests. The rule here is they are to be treated with the same way as Daddy. If serving a guest and serving Daddy are in conflict, I serve Daddy. Like all things with him, this scares me but turns me on in equal measure. I can’t wait to see what happens. He won’t tell me what they are like or what they might do. Just to expect them to come visit.\n\nI’ve shared this part of me with people I know online, and two really close friends IRL, but that’s it. Most don’t understand why I’d do something like this. My two friends have a “don’t kink shame” mindset to me and that’s about it. Even with all this space, I do not know how to explain it well to those who don’t feel the way I do. Rationally, my actions make no sense. Though looking over some subreddits, I think you people get me, and some writings here inspired me to post. I really hope I turned some of you on too, honestly.\n\nThank you.\n\n——\n\nFinally some housekeeping information stuff for internet pervs who i’ve come to post something online. Consider reading this before DMing me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. No I’m not looking for a new daddy right now.\n2. I’m not looking to meet from here. Period.\n3. Sorry, I don’t trade pics, sorry. I’m white, short light-brown hair, 5 foot 6. That’s all I’ll let you know ;P. Go look at some porn.\n4. Yes I’m single but not looking for a relationship right now. Daddy isn’t by BF, and I would like one of those at some point. I don’t know what a good BF would be for me. Perhaps Just one that allowed these trips? I don’t know. As I said, I’m not looking for one right now.\n5. Yes, I’m a woman. You can believe me or not. I don’t care.\n6. Stop asking when I first took dick. It’s gross. The answer is 18 but I know what you’re getting at.\n7. I don’t have any other daddies or guys who treat me like this. It’s just my trips to see Daddy for now. I’m fine with that.",

While I have quotes in here, it’s mostly how I remember things happening. I don’t actually remember, word-for-word, what Daddy said to me but I know how he talks and remember the jist of what he said and have reconstructed form there. I’m putting this here as a kinda “I’m human, with a human memory memory”. Don’t get too mad if feel my story telling is clumsy.</p>\n\n<p>—</p>\n\n<p>So, to get it out the way, I’ve always preferred older men sexually.I prefer 50 or 60 year olds ideally. People have asked me why, and I don’t have a good answer. They just turn me on. I have “Daddy Issues” lol. I feel more relaxed around an older man. Like with a young guy I’ve got to be someone I’m not, while with an older guy I can be more uninhibited. That’s all I can say.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I’ve always liked is “being used”. That’s my word for it. I mean, I love just being a sex object. Being used for sex and nothing more. A “cumbucket”, a “slut”. I’ve always been this way. It’s always been my fantasy and what I want.</p>\n\n<p>So, I like being used my older men. That’s me. That’s my sex desires summed up!</p>\n\n<p>Like most I kept my filthy desires to myself mostly. I only acted on them out with partners who’d indulge me but they’d always be strings attached. Like, I’d date someone and let them know, but it’s weird to be used by someone you’re dating because they are are also trying to build a connection with you. How do I go from being sex object to being romanced? So it never really worked</p>\n\n<p>With that unscratched itch I’d go chat online to guys. I used to frequent chatiw. It’s actually a very crappy chat app which I wouldn’t recommend (people on there are just “off” and if you’re a girl you’re overwhelmed with people asking you for pics or just being weird). Either way, I spent a lot of time there when I was bored, especially during the pandemic. Sometimes I’d just go on to talk with familiar faces.</p>\n\n<p>One day, about August 2020 I get a message from a guy. As a start it was all standard. I knew the procedure. Lots of sex talk, sharing experiences, them begging for pics, me withholding because I don’t feel comfortable, etc. For whatever reason, this guy stuck. I enjoyed his chat. He was 62 at the time and I was 22. He’d never married but had had some GFs. He was retired and was living his best life in SoCal (not crazy far as I live in NorCAl). He had a nice house with a pool and hot tub (which I thought was , and still think is, living like a king). He was fit for his age, worked out and ran regularly. A little belly but not what I’d think of as fat. Thick hair on his chest. Good masculine face with a full head of grayed hair. White., 5 foot 10” tall. He had a big cut dick, 7 inches when erect and a noticeable thickness to it, even when flacid. For me, he was great. He told me to call him “Daddy”. I do know his real name, but that’s all I’ve ever called him.</p>\n\n<p>He explained to me his need for a “slave”. He wanted someone to live in with him and own. Someone to use however he wanted. This excited me and we kept talking, eventually taking it into private phone chat apps.</p>\n\n<p>For a week or so it was just horny chat. We’d traded fantasies, pics, and vids. Eventually we called, and FaceTimed. We matched well in terms of what we wanted but I made it clear I didn’t want to be a “slave” for real. It was a fantasy but I wanted my own life most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>It being the pandemic, we both had more time on our hands than we knew what to do with, and we spent it talking and playing sexy games. The biggest one was I gave him control over my orgasms. I promised if he sent me a text asking me to orgasm, I’d drop what I was doing and do it. Naturally, he’d try to wear me out with it at all times, sometimes one right after another. Sometimes I’d tell him I can’t because I was tired or I’d ignore his messages, and he’d get frustrated. Naturally, from afar, he had no real control. You know how it is, you don’t want to play sex games and you can get away with avoiding them.</p>\n\n<p>The pandemic kept going and we kept talking. Eventually we agreed that when things started to open up again, we’d meet. I’d fly to him for a few days and during that time I’d be his slave.</p>\n\n<p>Over time rules developed for this meet we were planning. These were never really written down but were developed over time and just mutually understood. Basically they were:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I’d be naked at all times at his home.</li>\n<li>It’d just be him and me there. No guests [see the end of this post for an update on this].</li>\n<li>He’d not do anything to cause damage or anything that could endanger me, but stuff that caused pain like slapping and stretching was ok and I’d just need to put up with it.</li>\n<li>No Shit (piss was ok though).</li>\n<li>While I was there, my body would be his to use assuming the other rules were respected.</li>\n<li>I’d follow his orders though I’d be forced if they weren’t followed anyway.</li>\n<li>When he didn’t need me I could do as I pleased. Watch TV, enjoy the pool and hot tub, anything, but I’d need to stop when he wanted me.</li>\n<li>I could use my phone but it couldn’t get in the way of anything he wanted. I had to promise to not reveal what was happening to friends and family.</li>\n<li>I’d address him as “Daddy” (I already did anyway, but it’d be the same in person).</li>\n<li>If at any point I wanted to leave I was to say “I want to go to the hotel”. At this point, everything would stop. I’d get my clothes back on, and he’d drive me to a hotel and pay for me to stay there without him until my return flight. They’d be no shame in this, he would not debate it and would respect it. That’d be it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rule 10 was the most important. I had worried how best to marry my desire of being used while also having an opt out in case, well, I needed to. Like most into this, I want my calls for “No” to be overridden…. There’s a fun in it. Yet, understandably, guys don’t want the rape charge on their record when things go wrong. This rule was perfect. I could always leave but, as he put it it “it’s an all or nothing deal”. I was either his slave 100% or I’d leave. I couldn’t pick and choose how I served him. My choice was what he wanted, or a hotel without him. That was the extent of my freedom</p>\n\n<p>This rule seemed F-Upped a bit at first, but, over time I’ve come to realize it’s just a safe word (or phrase in this case). And when I say it, he stops. Unlike most safe words, there’s ingenious incentive not to say it. I can’t just say it because I’m uncomfortable or don’t want to do something. I can only say it when I literally need to go home. It’s really the last resort.</p>\n\n<p>We agreed a week would be a good period of time. I’d fly to SoCal on Monday and leave Sunday, and see how it goes. He agreed to pay for my flight which I appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the pandemic (waiting for our vaccines), my schooling, and just not finding the right time that worked for both us, we ended up meeting in June of 2021. We’d kept in contact, naturally. By this time I knew him very well, especially how demanding he was.</p>\n\n<p>The time came and I flew down. I told my parents I was going on a trip with friends (renting a place with a pool and having a college summer break), and told my friends I was vacationing with my parents. It worked. No one batted an eye. I left a note hidden in my bedroom drawer explaining exactly what I was doing just in case. I know I’m messed up but I wanted my parents to know what happened if it did all turn out to be a serial killers trap! (Spoiler: I’m alive and well and the letter was never found!).</p>\n\n<p>He picked me up from the airport. When we were in the car I confess I felt a little weird. I had assumed I’d be relaxed but things in person felt a little off. Like, someone I’d only seen remotely was now right next to me. I wondered if I should just get out there and then.</p>\n\n<p>After some short back-and-forth ‘how are you?; Nice flight?’ conversation (that did not flow easily) there was a pause and he reached over and began to grope me through my pants. I then reached over and started to tug at him through his. I remember at that moment I no longer felt weird, like some ice had been broken. On the car ride back he told me to drop my pants a little and play with myself while reaching over and fondling him a bit. I did. I don’t know if anyone saw but I was thrilled to think any car that passed us might get a peek, especially as we got into slower residential streets.</p>\n\n<p>When we parked at his place, I pulled up my pants and went inside with him and my suitcase (the suitcase was just full of clothes in case I needed the hotel, everything else for me was provided by him). His place was great. I’d seen it though video chat before but it looked better in person. When I got in the door he took my suitcase and said “get naked and I’ll put this all away for the week”. Of course, he’d seen me naked before and I felt no shame in quickly getting undressed. He took my clothes with my suitcase and threw them deep into a cupboard. I knew I’d only see them again when I left.</p>\n\n<p>He then approached me and said “it starts now”. He then, without missing a second of time began squeezing my left boob uncomfortably hard. I winced and he said “Oh, so sensitive” sarcastically as he tortured me a bit with it. Then he stopped and took his clothes off. I waited for him. I remember so strongly at this time, feeling the residual pain in my boob, and knowing he was about to use me. There was just one phrase running through my head: “What have I done?”. I’m sure anyone with a fetish knows this. The feeling that maybe this fantasy should have just remained a fantasy, and maybe the reality is… just not fun. With this feeling inside me he looked at me and commanded “Get sucking”. I got my to knees as requested and took him in my mouth, pushing those thoughts of doubt aside.</p>\n\n<p>I know what he’s like. When he’s not came in a while (like…. Hours) he wants rough and fast. He wants to get out that easy load, and saves longer session for after. Not long after sucking him he grabbed my head and started to facefuck me. As I’ve come to expect from him, there was no holding back. He was on a mission. I struggled to take him being this forceful but when I instinctively raised my hand he slapped it away. The message was clear. I gagged and chocked. I was fortunate not to puke, but I felt I might for a while. I don’t know how long this lasted, there, in the hallway, but eventually he came deep down my throat as I gagged on his dick. We’d talked about this moment for so long. The first act. I could’ve predicted exactly what he would do but it was still intense for me. His first load in me after 10 months of talking. Then he pulled back. He told me to turn around and look at myself in a mirror that was hanging from a closet door. There I was naked, with fluids of all kinds over my face, makeup running, my hair a mess. I really did look like the final frame in a hardcore porno…</p>\n\n<p>After this we went to the bedroom. He’d always told me he was someone “blessed with a high drive”. Guys have told me stuff like this before but few delivered. He did. He told me when we first started talking he cums “4 times a day minimum” and at the time I found that crazy high until I got to know him and realized this was true and really only the tip of the iceberg. With me there, I knew it’d be higher. He warned me it may feel non-stop.</p>\n\n<p>He then lay back on the bed and asked me to suck him until hard again. That didn’t take long. Then he demanded I ride him, which I did as he lay back and relaxed. Anyone who’s done it knows, riding can be exhausting, and I felt that exhaustion after a while. He could see it in my face and said “it’ll be worse if you stop, work that dick”. I did. Eventually he tells me it’s time for my ass. I wasn’t surprised. He knew he could and I knew he’d want to use all holes on the first day, just to try them. I’d been training with my toys on his request. Anal was hard for me. Never comfortable, always some pain. He warned me he “just spits” for lube so…</p>\n\n<p>He spat his hand and rubbed his dick, then did so again to reach into my ass and finger it. It still felt so dry, but it’s all I was getting. Then I went and mounted him. For me, the first insertion is always so painful. Every cell in my body wants to back out. It’s like pushing sandpaper up there. But with my toys, I had learned to just endure this and it’d get better. Thankfully he was laying down so I had some control. It was painful, somehow more so than when I had practiced at home, but I grinned and did it.When I reached the base he grabbed my hips and started humping me, enjoying my discomfort. However, I did not let that discomfort stop me from riding and doing my best.</p>\n\n<p>After some of this he flipped me and went in my ass with my face down on the bed. While I was face-down he went at me hard and fast and regularly slapped my ass while calling me every name under the sun. Then, he came.</p>\n\n<p>I lay in bed with him for a moment. I asked if he was satisfied and he simply said “yes. I’m going to lay here and relax a bit, you put your head between my legs and suck on me gently”. I did. I do not exaggerate to say I was there for over an hour. Taking his dick gently in my mouth. It got hard eventually but he just liked it as a massage. He clearly wasn’t horny enough to want to cum, but enjoyed the gentle sensation as he just lay in bed and closed his eyes; almost like a nap. At some point I’m getting tired and he begins to move. I assume that meant he’s done but he says “I’m going to piss in your mouth ok? It’ll be a slow release and I don’t want you to drop any. You swallow ok?Learn fast”.</p>\n\n<p>My experience of piss being minimal outside of his games of me drinking some of my own (yip…), I was worried. It was about as pleasant as you can imagine, and the slow stream seemed to last forever. Finally he was done.</p>\n\n<p>By this point it was late and he told me I was free to explore the house for a bit. I did. I got in the pool and hottub. It was luxury. As I’m walking around the living room enjoying the place he comes up to me and without warning slaps me across the face. I’m shocked. Going from tranquil to pain like that took me off guard. I look at him with fear as I rub my face. He smiles and says “You’re wondering why I did that?”, and I respond ‘yeah… did I do something wrong?”. He then replied “No, I did it because I felt like it. You agree I can?”. Then his wicked smile widened and I responded, simply “yes”. He then commanded I orgasm 3 times for him, right there. I did and he fucked me again, giving me his third load before we both went to bed, concluding our first day together.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next day things kept going at that pace. The days begin to merge in my memory but I’d be awoke, sometimes in the middle of the night, to his urges, and I’d do whatever he needed. He’d cum multiple times a day and often just enjoy me sucking him for hours on end. There was plenty of piss and he’d enjoy seeing me in pain so that was always a point for him. Slapping, squeezing, man handling me. In the down-time I’d enjoy myself as if at a luxury hotel but sooner or later he’d need me. I’d guess on average I took take 7 loads a day. At least, he orgasmsed about that much, sometimes the loads were pretty dry. Sometimes I’d work a few out in one session. I know that sounds high… but that’s just how he is.</p>\n\n<p>I remember by the time day three came around I was tired, and I felt like maybe I was no longer enjoying my life there. In a sense, why would I be enjoying it at all? I was just his slave. I was used by him as he wanted. That led to the the first time I told him “no”. I remember he pushed me down to suck his dick but I was tired after a day of service. I pushed his arm away and said “no, not now” firmly. Even though we had discussed it, I was somehow shocked by how little he cared about this. I guess I had assumed he was bluffing a bit, somehow, about not accepting no for an answer, but he was not. In fact, he seemed to enjoy the rebellion. All he did was grab my head and force me onto the dick. As I struggled away he facefucked me. He didn’t cum and released me when he had had his fun. He then said “I didn’t say it’d be easy. I know what I want”. I then answered that I just didn’t want to right now, that I needed a break. He then said something that stuck with me “This is real-life now. You can’t just ignore your texts or make an excuse.You know how to get out of this but that means leaving here for good. You can do that, or you can stay. It’s up to you. I’m either going to get everything the way I want it or nothing”. That rule again… He looked at me waiting for a response. I agonized. Short-term me wanted to leave. The idea of a quiet hotel where I could rest felt good but I felt, somehow, I’d live to regret doing that… that I needed to see this through. I then responded that I was sorry and asked if he needed anything with defeat in my tired voice. He then said “we’ll continue to play, I’m still hard, and tonight, you will suck my dick gently as I sleep. You will not stop until I say. It could well be all night. This is how you’re going to prove yourself back to me. Learn to deal with a life without ‘No’ and serve ”. So, I did do that for him. After our rough exhausting play, I sucked him gently for 5 hours. Him falling in and out of sleep as I gently nursed his cock. 5 hellish hours where I just wanted to rest. Eventually grabbed my head and lifted me up. “Enough” he said. I got about an two hours sleep before starting the next day.</p>\n\n<p>Things became even more of a blur but, also, I feel like I started to adapt after my little breakdown. I was always tired and took naps when I wasn’t needed but Often awoken by him wanting something. We’d snack more than eat, and I’d lay by the pool on downtime. I did exercises when I could to not become too much of a couch potato. When he didn’t need me, when he was satisfied, he’d go about little things like watch TV or browse the web. He had some hobbies he’d attend to and did some work outs on his equipment. I asked him what he did with all his free time and he told me that this was pretty much it minus me being here. He told me he’d just jerk it a lot more. He then told me he deserved a slave and that me being one for him gave me purpose. This made me so horny despite all the sex and exhaustion. I asked him more about my “purpose” and he explained that I was meant to do this, that I was born to serve men. He unravelled this whole philosophy about how men were made to spread seed and women made to accept it. That men were not living authentically by restraining themselves and women should serve. He explained he had these desires for a reason and he was right to act on them. Cum was life bringing, and sexual desire is what spread it. All our lives came from it. He said how we were living was “the way it was meant to be”. In that state at time, being sleep deprived and used like crazy, I felt this was all very profound (despite it clearly just being the ramblings of a horn-dog). It turned me on and kept me going for the rest of the day. I think part of me believed him. I think part still might.</p>\n\n<p>As the week went on, we did everything, and I felt everything. Someone cumming in me used to be a somewhat rare thing but by a point it felt as ordinary as drinking water. You just lose count. You stop even remembering what the last thing was. Just focused on the here and now. He used me as his urinal whenever it was easier than doing so elsewhere. I sometimes spilled a little, and he’d slap me hard and make me lick it up. I learned to just zone out when I gave him extended sucking, which he liked when he was relaxing (typically watching tv or on his computer), I don’t know how to explain it. I just got in a rhythm and somehow the time passed. Hours. Sometimes I’ll realize what I’m doing, like “Oh shit, I’m sucking, how long’s it been?”. The only change in the fact would be as as he stiffens up to cum in me. Didn’t take me long to know exactly what to do to push all the buttons. He’d still use my throat and sometimes I’d vomit a bit but he seemed to like this mess. Proud of it basically. Pain was always, well, painful, but every so often I’d look and see how happy it made him to see me squirm and such and… like, I felt I was doing a good job sometimes. My ass got used to things and my pussy was filled and was requested to regularly cum.</p>\n\n<p>There were, of course, several points when I wanted to quit but I always moved forwards. I kept thinking about my “purpose” to him. He mentioned that purpose was something that gave your life meaning, but it didn’t mean it was always easy. Damn… he knew how to get in my head and when I’d satisfied him, I felt good about myself too. He wasn’t big on rewards, as you can imagine, but he wanted pleasure and he got pleasure whenever he wanted. It was a lot of work, but it was all me. My life was completely devoted to one mans sexual needs during that time. That was it. That was me. Every whim. He told me once that he’d take everything from me just for one more second of pleasure… That if me staying up all night meant he got a little more happiness, he’d make me stay up all night. I respected that. I told him I wanted a daddy who puts his pleasure first and he was that. I asked him once if this week was what he wanted and he said “yes, you’re enabling me to have the life I deserve.”… I was so proud of myself.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually the time came to leave. I got clothed and he drove me to the airport. There was no grand farewell. He said he was disappointed it was over but that was it. When I got back to NorCal we kept talking and by January of this year I was already back for 5 days (all I could do with school). I’ve already spoken enough but as you can imagine it was basically the same deal as before. I’m going to head down in the middle of next month too for a full week. I hope to keep this going at this frequency.</p>\n\n<p>At this stage, I consider it my vacation, all expenses paid. It’s my way to let this side of me out. It’s a way to enjoy my sex life and my unusual kinks. He’s talked to me about me moving in on a permanent basis with him after I’m done with college but I’ve always declined. Doing this as a vacation is great but full-time… it’s totally different. He does want this to happen and has given me a lot of offers (“time off” to build a career, rest days, and, yes, marry him for his inheritance once I’ve served him to the end! (I’m really not joking here, he’s telling the truth)) but, personally, I need these things to have an end date for the foreseeable future. Who knows how I’ll feel going forward. I don’t want to burn any bridges, but, for now, this is enough. He jokes I’ll come crawling to him for slavery once the “real world” crushes me ;P.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing we’re going to change when I visit next month is we’re scrapping the “No guests” rule. This was a rule he’d put down to put me early on to put us both at ease as I’d said I’d only feel comfortable serving one guy. But, things have changed. He’s talked about me with some of his friends and they want to come visit and play. So, yes, I’m going to accept guests. The rule here is they are to be treated with the same way as Daddy. If serving a guest and serving Daddy are in conflict, I serve Daddy. Like all things with him, this scares me but turns me on in equal measure. I can’t wait to see what happens. He won’t tell me what they are like or what they might do. Just to expect them to come visit.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve shared this part of me with people I know online, and two really close friends IRL, but that’s it. Most don’t understand why I’d do something like this. My two friends have a “don’t kink shame” mindset to me and that’s about it. Even with all this space, I do not know how to explain it well to those who don’t feel the way I do. Rationally, my actions make no sense. Though looking over some subreddits, I think you people get me, and some writings here inspired me to post. I really hope I turned some of you on too, honestly.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>——</p>\n\n<p>Finally some housekeeping information stuff for internet pervs who i’ve come to post something online. Consider reading this before DMing me!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>No I’m not looking for a new daddy right now.</li>\n<li>I’m not looking to meet from here. Period.</li>\n<li>Sorry, I don’t trade pics, sorry. I’m white, short light-brown hair, 5 foot 6. That’s all I’ll let you know ;P. Go look at some porn.</li>\n<li>Yes I’m single but not looking for a relationship right now. Daddy isn’t by BF, and I would like one of those at some point. I don’t know what a good BF would be for me. Perhaps Just one that allowed these trips? I don’t know. As I said, I’m not looking for one right now.</li>\n<li>Yes, I’m a woman. You can believe me or not. I don’t care.</li>\n<li>Stop asking when I first took dick. It’s gross. The answer is 18 but I know what you’re getting at.</li>\n<li>I don’t have any other daddies or guys who treat me like this. It’s just my trips to see Daddy for now. I’m fine with that.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
