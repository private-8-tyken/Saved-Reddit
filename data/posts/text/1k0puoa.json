  "title": "I fucked up my life by flirting with a coworker",
  "selftext": "I’m not looking for sympathy when I say this, but I genuinely feel like I did it to myself. I was having fun flirting with a coworker, to the point that it was basically emotionally cheating, and I thought I was in control, but I wasn’t.\n\nI regret it. I think about it constantly, like this loop I can’t shut off. What I said. What I didn’t say. I didn’t want it. Not really, not like that. I didn’t even say yes. I just didn’t say no loud enough. I let myself freeze, and that was enough for him.\n\n\nThings with my boyfriend have been bad for a long time. I don’t say this as an excuse, but just to paint a picture. There was no big fight, no big betrayal, but just a lack of excitement and presence. All date planning, romance, whatever, was completely on me. No affection. Infrequent and, bluntly, bad sex. I was lonely. Not horny, not looking. Bored, I guess.\n\nAround that same time, I had a new coworker start at my job. We got on well. He flirted, and eventually, I reciprocated. I enjoyed the attention, the way he made me feel. Months of this flirting passed, us getting more familiar, tension building. I don’t know what the fuck I was doing. I feel like I’ve been living my life on autopilot.\n\nWell, it all blew up in my face. I was working. He was working. We were having a good time and probably being a little too friendly. Extremely unusual for us, but we had been let go early on a Friday (early as in like 5pm) and he insisted we celebrate with a drink. He had a place in mind. I had never gone out with him outside of work before, but it seemed appropriate given I got the night off so much earlier than expected.\n\nA few drinks in, we’re buzzed, laughing. It wasn’t sexual then, but still far too friendly. I should have stopped it. I didn’t.\n\nWe’re getting about ready to say goodbye, when he suddenly mentions he lives half a block away. First time I’m hearing about it. He tells me that he really wants to show his place off to me before I go. The way he says it isn’t really a question. I knew it would be crossing another line but my curiosity got the better of me. We walk over together and it really is as close as he said. I remember my heart racing as we were approaching his door, like I knew what I was doing was a bad idea.\n\nHe changed up so quick as soon as that door closed. I could just tell the way he was looking at me. Intense, domineering. He closed the space between us and basically pinned me to the wall. He didn’t ask me if I wanted to. He just told me. Grabbed me. I remember his fingers pressing into my arm, it was possessive. He tried to kiss me but I turned my head away. I felt his lips on my neck instead. My mind was racing. I said I wasn’t sure, that it was weird. He physically flinched at that, stopped himself for a moment. Then told me that we didn’t have to have sex, we could have fun in other ways. And then he had moved on, kissing my neck again. I honestly don’t even know what I was thinking. It was all happening so fast and I was numb.\n\nI remember being aware that he was undoing his pants, but it was like before I could even take a breath, there it was, out. He was hard. Big. He told me flatly he wanted to feel my mouth. Then his hand was on the back of my head, a gentle push. I was freaking out internally, indecisive. All I could get out was “wait, wait, wait…” He paused again at that, looking confused. I should have said stop, no, anything. I should have spoken up. But after we both just sat there frozen for a few moments, he started again. Just told me how bad he wanted me and then he was using both hands to guide me onto my knees. Now I’m pressed to the cold, uncomfortable hardwood floor. There’s pressure on the back of my head from his hand and pressure from his cock poking at my lips, trying to get in. I didn’t make some conscious decision.\n\nBefore I’m even sure which way is up, my mouth is stretching to accommodate him as he pushes himself forward. I remember my cheeks stinging, flushing as the blood rushed to my face. I remember he was very warm, hot against the walls of my mouth, and there was this weight to it as he was resting it on my tongue. I already distinctly feel full, at capacity. That feeling is quickly proved wrong as he keeps pushing forward, keeps finding more and more empty space in my mouth to cram himself into. He didn’t stop. He just kept pulling me along, his hand on the back of my head. Kept thrusting forward, his hips pressing against my face.\n\nHe was quick and rough, less than a minute maybe. Done and over before my brain could even catch up. I just kneeled there, numb. Knowing he was about to finish. Already reeling with guilt before it was even over tbh. Then he was moaning loudly and I was feeling his heat flooding into my mouth in waves. His twitching and trembling quickly puttered out, and then it was over.\n\nHe was so casual. “Thanks” he told me. “That felt amazing” he told me. No mention of my boyfriend, who he is very well aware of. He already got what he wanted, no need to address the touchy subject I guess.\n\nBefore leaving, I made him promise to never tell a soul, that literally no one else could ever know. I think he’s good for the secret and no one else at work seems to know yet, it’s been about a month.\n\nThings have been weird between us since. Nothing else has really happened, but we haven’t returned to our normal banter. I think he knows that I regret it, maybe even that it wasn’t totally consensual. And I think he feels guilty. But that’s just me analyzing, I don’t know.\n\nI’m still indecisive about what to do with my boyfriend. I’ve already decided I’m never going to tell him, judge me if you want. But obviously this has only made things worse in our relationship, I am living a lie… I feel like I’m just putting off the inevitable breakup at this point.\n\nFeels like I fucked up my relationship, this new friendship, maybe even the job itself (which I love), all in one stupid moment.\n\nI keep fantasizing about it though. It seems silly, getting off to a scenario where I am not receiving any direct pleasure, but it is literally the most exciting, most significantly memorable sex I’ve had in years, so I guess that’s where the obsession is building from. \n\n",

            "body": "There's a certain amount of distance from sex and such in flirting sometimes, but in my life I've seen that mostly from women. He clearly overstepped several lines, consent isn't just not saying no. Consent should be enthusiastic and active, not ignoring someone telling you to wait.\n\nYes you fucked up by flirting with him, but it seems like from your other comments that had you a) not been drinking b) been in your comfort zone at work and c) not been in an unfamiliar area that he knew, then you wouldn't have gone back to his place. Uncertainty about consequences is a major driver of bad decisions, and he - consciously or not doesn't matter - took advantage of that. He is not innocent in this, and you are far more innocent than him. Yes it never gets here without you reciprocating the flirting, but girl,,, no amount of flirting equals a yes to having someone shove their penis in your mouth.\n\nI hope you're seeking out trusted friends or professionals that might be able to help you talk through this and understand what you want to do next. I imagine filing police reports, HR or even telling people is daunting - and possibly unreasonable to you considering it would reveal the part that *is* cheating; the long period of emotional cheating and flirting.\n\nBest of luck, godspeed",

He clearly overstepped several lines, consent isn&#39;t just not saying no. Consent should be enthusiastic and active, not ignoring someone telling you to wait.</p>\n\n<p>Yes you fucked up by flirting with him, but it seems like from your other comments that had you a) not been drinking b) been in your comfort zone at work and c) not been in an unfamiliar area that he knew, then you wouldn&#39;t have gone back to his place. Uncertainty about consequences is a major driver of bad decisions, and he - consciously or not doesn&#39;t matter - took advantage of that. He is not innocent in this, and you are far more innocent than him. Yes it never gets here without you reciprocating the flirting, but girl,,, no amount of flirting equals a yes to having someone shove their penis in your mouth.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you&#39;re seeking out trusted friends or professionals that might be able to help you talk through this and understand what you want to do next. I imagine filing police reports, HR or even telling people is daunting - and possibly unreasonable to you considering it would reveal the part that <em>is</em> cheating; the long period of emotional cheating and flirting.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck, godspeed</p>\n</div>",

He knew he was going to violate you, to rape you, when he asked you to have a drink. He knew when he insisted that you see his place.\n\nHe could have stopped himself, but he didn’t.\n\nHe had some serious advantage over the situation. He planned it. He abused your overall state of mind and your very recent state of mind combined. He was a very patient predator. There is basicly nothing you could have done.

He clearly overstepped several lines, consent isn't just not saying no. Consent should be enthusiastic and active, not ignoring someone telling you to wait.\n\nYes you fucked up by flirting with him, but it seems like from your other comments that had you a) not been drinking b) been in your comfort zone at work and c) not been in an unfamiliar area that he knew, then you wouldn't have gone back to his place. Uncertainty about consequences is a major driver of bad decisions, and he - consciously or not doesn't matter - took advantage of that. He is not innocent in this, and you are far more innocent than him. Yes it never gets here without you reciprocating the flirting, but girl,,, no amount of flirting equals a yes to having someone shove their penis in your mouth.\n\nI hope you're seeking out trusted friends or professionals that might be able to help you talk through this and understand what you want to do next. I imagine filing police reports, HR or even telling people is daunting - and possibly unreasonable to you considering it would reveal the part that *is* cheating; the long period of emotional cheating and flirting.\n\nBest of luck, godspeed",

He knew when he insisted that you see his place.\n\nHe could have stopped himself, but he didn’t.\n\nHe had some serious advantage over the situation. He planned it. He abused your overall state of mind and your very recent state of mind combined. He was a very patient predator. There is basicly nothing you could have done. You froze because you subconscious mind wanted to protect you, so he wont beat the shit out of you and THEN rape you.\n\nYou are not guilty. He is. And your boyfriend also has a role in it. „Not fair“ by Lily Allen comes to mind. \n\n\nIf you can, try to find therapy. Or at least a group like the aa but for rape victims. \n\nThat being said, if the scene pops up in your mind and makes you wet, maybe you want to try (cnc) roleplay online.",
