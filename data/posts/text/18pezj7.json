  "title": "On the train…",
  "selftext": "I sat down on the train, this guy was staring at me, I really didn’t know why. I waved at him and he kept motioning for me to get next to him so, well I do. I honestly didn’t think I was baiting. I just.. i sat there, asked him where he was going, and just like smiled at him. He didn’t seem to speak english and i just was like oh ok i can just sit with him.\n\nAnd he starts rubbing his leg on me. And then he starts putting his palm out and starts rubbing his dick through his pants. I enter fawn mode and naïvely put my hand on his and he rubs it on his cock. \n\nI go full fawn mode, only lightly trying to escape, generally looking terrified but docile. He rubs it and I just let my hand go, I don’t give him what he wants. And then he takes off his coat and gets his dick out from under it. I just… he makes me grab it and humps my hand.. i kind of fawn harder and stroke him a little bit…\n\nEDIT: he grabbed my ass about here in it too\n\nHe just.. he eventually forces my mouth on his cock and the first time I just take it and suck him. He fucks my face.. it.. its so calming to be assaulted the fawning is the best feeling I was so arroused.. he eventually starts grabbing my tits.. i assume he notices my piercings and he well.. grabs my tits so fucking hard.. abusively.. as much as I like all this like I have to get away. I can’t get in trouble for indecent exposure here. He pulls me back I can’t get away. I keep fawning.\n\nHe just.. forces me to suck him but this time I don’t give in. I have so much hair in the way. He tries to force his cock in my mouth anyway and fails. \n\nHe at some point tries to touch me and i absolutely cannot have him find I’m trans. I worry he’ll get.. violent.. so I just.. keep going he puts me down probably i added this paragraph because i forgot earlier\n\nI get up. I notice the ticket person. I realize i think I dropped my ticket. I look for it fuck I don’t have it. I just.. he grabs my tits harder. Pinches my nipple.. i fawn so hard but I have to escape.. i just.. he grabs my arm and just.. fucks my hand again. I don’t want to get in trouble I’m in a foriegn country…\n\nI think this is actually where I looked for my ticket. He leaves me alone at last and I finally escape.\n\nI sit and am the next person in line to be ticketed. I honestly just wanted it over and to be not at fault. The person getting ticketed has to buy a ticket. There’s no signal.. it takes forever… i panick and look for my ticket but i know its over there. I can’t go back i can’t fawn again. So I look and then resign myself. I hate telling but I have to. I know its not but it feels like my fault, like I baited him by existing. If I just ran away at first he would have gotten where he needed..\n\nBut alas.. my ticket has to be by him. So I just.. i say the truth.. my ticket is over there, but I cant get it because that man touched me. And just.. i don’t want him to get kicked off but I know its the right thing so he doesn’t touch anyone else. And besides like.. this girl was right there she saw the whole thing if I didn’t run away she could have told on me for being a pervert… but so.. i was good I ran away.. i was always trying to run away..\n\nThey find him.. the ask me.. do i want to report and I say I just want to be away from him. Eventually they.. kick him off.. the girl next to me corroborated my story… im.. safe.. i\n\nI..\n\nI open up my messages to tell all my fucked up friends the good news. I got assaulted. I was dumb and sat next to the guy i literally just said was stating at me.. i know its my fault but at the same time I know its not… he felt so good.. if I was alone and no one saved me who knows what he would have done to me. But i.. i got my addiction to abuse fed. Except I at least managed it. i didn’t go gone with him and i didn’t let him get away with the absolute dumbass move of assaulting me in such a public place. If he wasn’t a dumbass he could have forced me into the toilet…\n\nSo.. here i am… getting a shot of the strongest drug. Typing out my beautiful fawning response to tell more people Im fucked up.. to just.. at least get something out of this… i have to just.. be responsible.. i have to take care of myself I can’t just.. well no.. i can. I won’t stop engaging with strangers because oh what if they assault me.. i need to talk to strangers i’d just.. take the risk over never just getting to know them. I know thats partially a cover for the fact I want more assaults but I don’t care.. i really love talking its just I love rape more.. \n\nIm.. im learning to cope.. i have a domme to manage me she cares.. she’ll.. probably stop letting me leave the house alone someday if i really need to stop being assaulted.. she’ll fuck me up so hard I.. won’t want amateurs.\n\nYet.. i just.. im not safe in public. I’m too battered and docile and just… addicted.. well no.. the addiction isn’t the main factor.. in a just world i could do anything and people wouldn’t assault mr and wanting to control it with bait is just.. both an addiction and a coping mechanism. I’m fucking giddy tying this all out, being smart and typing it as a note because fuck reddit’s laggy ass app.\n\nI don’t know. I.. you know I wasn’t baiting this time. This was “unwanted” rape. And look at me seeing more guys and smiling.. happy… docile…. I did what I could..\n\nIts time to let it go for now…\n\nFUCKING HELL another guy just.. looked at me and motioned… if he grabbed my hand i.. would have let him if he tries i don’t know what to do…",
