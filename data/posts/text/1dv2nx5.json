  "title": "Every year I get raped on my birthday",
  "selftext": "It's coming up and it's all I can think about. \n\nThe first time was my 18th. My best friend and I threw a huge birthday party with basically everyone I knew, and a lot of people I didn't. She was always the loud, outgoing one so there were tons of people I had never seen before. It was at her house so I felt pretty comfortable. It was also the first time I got sloppy-drunk. I remember she was feeding me shots, I remember hanging out with a (mostly male) group of her friends, I remember one of them shared his cigarette and my friend and I shotgunning smoke before making out in front of them. My mind was spinning but I was loving the attention, it was the first time I felt cool. \n\nThe night took a turn from there, and before I knew it I could barely keep my eyes open. I think my best friend helped me into her spare bedroom, but I could hear the party keep going downstairs. I fell asleep until I awoke because there was some pressure on the bed, and soon after hands caressing my thighs. The person lifted up my dress and I tried to move but he shushed me and my limbs felt really heavy. Next thing I knew he was pulling my panties aside and putting a finger into me. It was uncomfortable and I know I mumbled something but I don't know what. I tried to move my head to look at him but his hand pushed me down by the hair so I was pressed against the mattress as he undid his pants and entered me. I tried to fight back but it was useless. Eventually, I laid there and took it. He came in me and left. I never saw his face. \n\nMy 19th I had a boyfriend I had been seeing for a couple of months. The one year anniversary of my rape was more in my mind than anything else. I told him I didn't want a party, he insisted on knowing why. My excuses of being tired and not really up for it didn't seem to go through, so eventually I caved and told him. He dropped it after that. \n\nWhen my birthday came around I was relieved to find there was no grand celebration. He took me to dinner and everything was normal until we got home. He started saying how I seemed to have forgotten my place and needed to be raped again. I pushed him off and tried to play it off as a weird joke at first but he overpowered me and pinned me to the bed, on my back this time. He pawed at my body and told me I was a slut, all while I was begging him no and telling him it wasn't funny and to please let me go. He literally ripped my dress, buttons flying across the bedroom and shoved himself into me. He was rough and it hurt but eventually he started playing with my clit and I fucking came. He called me a good girl and said I was a good rapewhore. I was in denial that he raped me for a while, which leads me to my 20th birthday. \n\nSame dude (unfortunately). Our relationship had taken a turn for the worst and there was a lot of rough sex and dubious consent at best. He didn't even bother with the pleasantries this time. I woke up to him fucking me, I don't know how long he was in me before I gained consciousness. The whole day he referred to it as my 'rapeaversary' and was groping me and touching me. He took me to dinner and was touching me under the table almost the entire time. When we got home, I was prepared to have sex, I was on all fours waiting for him to fuck me when he went for my ass instead. I remember the pain was blinding and I screamed. It was my first time. I remember the fear when I realised it wasn't an accident. Every other time I had fought back but I froze, it reminded me so much of my first rape. He wasn't going slow either, it hurt and I was crying and begging him to get off me the whole time. He said I look pretty when I cried and started fingering me at the same time. It felt like every inch of me was on fire as he came inside and left me crying and gasping on the bed, his cum and some blood leaking out of me. \n\nMy 21st is soon and my current fuckbuddy knows I have a rapekink and all of the above. I hope he's planning something, but if he's not I might have to go baiting...",
