  "title": "My experiences and tips for face fucking and the question of puke.",
  "selftext": "This topic is not for everyone. Yet, I feel compelled to write about it for some of us out there that need a little more education or a different opinion to read. \n\nFirst of all, I'm a [27 y/o girl](http://i.imgur.com/NyPeX.jpg) that loves face fucking. I also have a horrible gag reflex. In daily life, I have a problem with anxiety and actually naturally gag and try not to puke when I'm nervous. I have been doing this since I was a little kid. Nothing has helped to get rid of it. Anyways, maybe that's a little part of why I love sucking cock so damn much. It's a huge challenge for me...and yet for the most part, I've conquered it and men love my blowjobs/facefucking/deepthroating. \n\nThe more I'm turned on, the less my gag reflex affects me. I had one incredible night where I got to play with two men. My gag reflex was almost completely gone. \n\nI could never just get face fucked. I always have to explain to men that they can't just start fucking my face. I have to train them on how to do it. Yes there is a technique for men to facefuck as well as for women. \n\nHere are my tips for men:\n\n1. Start by letting her have control. Let her suck slowly and get used to your cock. Let her feel comfortable. Build trust. No hands on head or grabbing of hair. \n\n2. Really listen to the girl and be sensitive to how she is looking and feeling. Go only as far as she lets you go. \n\n3. The angle your cock is going into her mouth is extremely important. \n     * For those lucky guys that have a cock that turns downward, you can facefuck standing up more easily. \n     * Those with straight cocks can also do this as the cock will bend inside, as it does inside the vagina. However, if it's really stiff it still might be a bit difficult. \n     * Those with cocks that are curved upwards, the best position is her on her back with her head hanging over the bed. Or any other position where the curve goes with the curve of her mouth and throat.\n     * Curved sideways? Lucky you and her, you can lay on your side, on the bed with her laying next to you.\n\n4. Understand her technique so that you can jive with it.\n\nMy tips for women:\n\n1. Lots and lots and lots of saliva. Fucking drool on that cock if you can.\n\n2. Go slow. **Tell him** you need to go slow and work your way up to it. It's more than okay to say you need practice and you might not be able to do it, but you still want to try. \n\n3. After you've gotten that trust going and your mouth is physically used to sucking his cock, you can start to let him face fuck you. Just start with the head in and out slowly. **Tell him** you only want him to go in and out a little to start. \n\n4. Take breaks. What makes a girl puke? Continual facefucking that's too deep...again I'll say, no breaks creates puke. Also it's the painful kind of puke (yes there is a different kind, but more on that later). \n\n5. When you're taking breaks use your hands to push back on him to tell him to stop facefucking you. Or however you need to do that. Give him a handjob in the meantime while you recover.\n\n6. This is one of the most important tips. In order to get face fucked deep you need to practice deep throating. \n     * Slowly see how much of his cock you can take before feeling like you need to gag. Then *stop* and go back to something else like the handjob, sucking or shallow facefucking (just the tip or however much of his cock you can handle getting fucked with). \n     * The surprise of this is a really nice treat for the guy (unless he doesn't get much out of deep throating).\n     * Every time you do this you'll get more comfortable with deep throating. You'll eventually be able to take it all the way to the back of your throat. I still gag a little when I do this, but men love it and it's such a small gag that it doesn't hurt. \n     *  When it hurts is when I am forced when I'm not ready. \n\n7. As you get better at deep throating, you can take more of his cock while he face fucks you.\n\n8. Your tongue is a fabulous tool. If you lift the back of your tongue it provides a barrier for the cock so that it doesn't go down further. Then the guy also feels a bit like he's bottoming out too. \n\n9. You can open your jaw a little less if you wrap your lips around your teeth. Again, you need a lot of saliva for this. For the guy, it feels pretty amazing. It's a tighter feeling. \n\n10. Don't open your jaw towards the front...it will make it hurt later. Open your jaw naturally swinging backwards. \n\n11. If a guy has a hard time cumming, sometimes it's because he needs to facefuck continually for a long time. I have realized this from experience. When I do that, I usually make myself as comfortable as possible and let him go in to right before the gag point. For me that's with my tongue high in the back so it stops him from going all the way. Then I like to let him go all the way when he cums. That way I don't have to taste it as much!\n\nI really think that both men and women who are into this, should read the tips for both sexes. Understanding what each other goes through is key. Communication is vital. It doesn't happen for most of us easily like it does in porn!\n\nOn the topic of puke. Some guys find it really hot for a girl to puke on the guy's cock. I can understand why. Either it's hot because it's degrading and animalistic. Or it's hot because it's the length that one would go to to please her man. Or because of the feeling of hotness and wetness. There are many reasons, and they are all valid. Just as long as the girl is into it, the people involved are communicative and caring. I love the BDSM term: \"Safe, sane and consensual.\" \n\nTo give you an interesting comparison on pain with puking. When I'm 100% into giving a blowjob and getting face fucked, I sometimes puke a little. Most of the time, the guy doesn't notice as I swallow it back up like it's extra saliva. It doesn't hurt at all either. There was a time though where a guy forced me down on him more when I wasn't ready. It hurt like fucking hell and sent sparks of pain throughout my whole body. \n\nThe point is, if she's going to puke for you and she's a novice let her do it by her pushing her own boundaries. When I puke on cock, it's because I wanted to push my boundaries with how long and how deep I can get facefucked. Then it just sort of happens. It doesn't feel like puking when you're sick. It just feels like \"oops I puked. sorry.\" However, if he's pushing you beyond your limits and you puke, it's going to hurt like hell. At least in my experience. I'd like to hear other's experiences on this. I also prefer to be in the shower doing this. I'm not hard core with a bowl and towel etc. \n\nI could probably go on about all this, but I'd love questions if you have any. Or your own experiences. Heck even your disapproval. \n\nTl;dr Facefucking rocks. Some men like puke. Communication is key to making it all work. Great face fucking and deepthroating come with practice and training, unlike what we see in porn.\n\n",
