  "title": "Strip poker with my friend's wife.",
  "selftext": "A while back when I was about 26 I had a 24 year old friend. I'd known her since she was 18 and I was 20, and had lusted after her the whole time but she had been dating a guy when we met and ended up marrying him - So I never took my shot with her.\n\nWe end up just very good friends. We hang out frequently enough that both her husband and some of the girls I dated during the time get jealous of our relationship even though we weren't doing anything.\n\nA few years down the line I have a get together at my place and invite all my friends (except the girl I had just started dating, I didn't feel like introducing her to people yet), including her and her husband. Her husband ended up being out of town that week so she came solo.\n\nThe party went smoothly, drinks were drank and food was eaten and everyone went home happy before midnight except for the girl in question who had drank too much and couldn't drive yet. It wasn't a big deal, she knew I'd let her chill here and it's not like her husband was waiting for her.\n\nShe threw herself down on my couch and we started watching TV or netflix or whatever and just chilled.\n\nAfter the show we were watching ended she said \"I'm bored. Lets play something. Do you have a chess set or something?\"\n\n\"No, I've got a deck of cards or monopoly.\"\n\n\"Get the cards then.\"\n\nNeither of us are really card players so we just started out playing 2 person blackjack for a bit. It ended up going about 60/40 to me, because she was too zealous to hit, but we weren't betting anything so it was fine.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of this I said \"Lets play poker, maybe you can win at that.\"\n\n\"Sure. How much money do you have?\"\n\nI never carry cash, and I told her this and said \"But shit, I'll bet my shirt against your money if you want.\"\n\n\"Ok!\" she said and laughed at me.\n\nLike I said, neither of us are card players so there was lots of checking the \"Poker Hand Ranks\" cheat sheet that came with the deck. I don't remember the play-by-play but I know that I took all her money by the time I was down to only my pants and boxers.\n\n\"Let me win it back,\" she said, and took off her sweat shirt and threw it on the table, leaving herself in her tank top with her bra visible through it.\n\nShe was sobering up by now but I guess the excitement of the game was enough to keep her in against her better judgement, because I eventually started intentionally losing just to help her and she still ended up in her bra and panties by the time she got my boxers off.\n\nSo there I am, naked, sitting on the floor across from this married woman in just her bra and panties. No way the game is ending now.\n\nI don't know what I said to talk her into continuing to play but she must have wanted to continue anyway, because we did. After 3 more hands she was also naked.\n\nshe looked at me up and down and her eyes lingered on my dick which was at half mast and enjoying the attention.\n\nI also looked her up and down. She was sitting with her foot blocking the view of her vag but I could see she was cleanly shaved and her cute pert little tits were open for all to see.\n\n\"Play for dares then?\" I asked\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\nI won, and I dared her to move her foot. She moved her foot for about 10 seconds and then moved it back, giving me enough time to see that she had an \"outie\" vagina and her pink inner lips were very exposed.\n\nThen she won, and she dared me to stroke until I was actually hard. I happily acceded.\n\nShe won again and she dared me to try to suck my own dick. I couldn't, but I tried. She laughed.\n\nI won and I dared her to walk out onto my balcony naked. She did it, leaning on the railing and giving me a nice view of her round ass and a glimpse of her pussy from behind. I stroked myself for a bit while she was turned around.\n\nI won again and dared her to get on her hands and knees in front of me and turn around, giving me an even better view of her ass and pussy from behind. I stroked even more at this point.\n\nShe won and she dared me to do the same, and then joked about how she was going to fuck me in the ass. I laughed.\n\nI won, and I dared her to stroke me for 10 seconds. She did. Her hand gently grasped my dick and began to stroke it. 10 seconds ended but she kept going. She spread her legs and let me get a good look at her pussy while she jerked me and while I looked into her eyes I reached forward and placed my hand over it. She shifted her hips and I began to rub her while she stroked my dick. Eventually she leaned forward and took me in her mouth.\n\nAfter a few minutes of sucking and fingering she told me \"Get a condom.\" so I did, and I threw her on couch and got on top of her.\n\nAs I slid inside her she whispered in my ear \"You can't ever tell Mark about this, he'll kill you.\" I laughed and she said \"No, seriously.\"\n\nI just kissed her and did my first gentle thrust out and back in to her tight pussy she gasped a bit and then kissed me back and we started fucking on my couch.\n\nI wish I could say I gave her the time of her life but after the last hour of teasing I think I lasted all of about 5 minutes. I didn't care though, I knew this was probably a one time thing so I just enjoyed having her while I could. Eventually her and her husband moved away for his job and our friendship faded over time but I still jerk off to the memories from that night.",
