  "selftext": "It started as a coping mechanism.\n\nMy university has a 'public safety' notification system where anytime something dangerous or violent takes place on or near campus, it will send you a notification (they have to do this as part of the [Clery Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clery_Act)). My mom, being the overprotective worrier that she is, of course made me sign up when I moved away for college. \n\nWhile at college, I was raped. But that's a different story.\n\nI still remember the first time after that rape when my phone received the notification: \"**Public Safety Advisory: Sexual Assault Near Campus.**\"\n\nHere I was, trying to forget this terrible thing that had just happened to me and all of a sudden I'm reminded of it â€” being told that it's just happened to some other poor person (probably some college girl just like me). And it's right here, so close to me. The victim could be someone I know. The rapist could be someone I know. I had a full-blown panic attack. \n\nI'm not sure why I didn't unsubscribe from the notifications. That would've been the healthy thing to do, but I suppose the trauma didn't have me thinking straight. So every time after that when I got a **Public Safety Advisory**, I'd suddenly feel my heart in my throat, and would struggle to breathe. It wouldn't always be a rape. Sometimes it'd be a mugging, or a fire, or some other such thing. In those cases I could breathe a sigh of relief (although I'd still feel like shit from the aftershocks of the initial fright). When it was a rape, I wouldn't just feel like shit, I would be absolutely devastated. I would imagine: 'what if that was me?', 'that could have been me... again'. And I would think back to how I felt when I was being raped. \n\nSo what's this coping mechanism? Well, remember mentioned that \"full-blown panic attack\" after the first notification? I left one detail out: \n\n**Attention Masturbating Perverts ðŸ˜œ, The 'Sexy' Part Begins Here:**\n\nAs I received the notification letting me know some girl on campus had just been raped,\nas I became hysterical thinking back to my own rape,\nI touched myself. And I hated myself for it. It was only after I came (and I hummed HARD), was I able to catch my breath and come down from my panic attack. And I hated myself for that even more. \n\nAbout two weeks later, when I got the next sexual assault notification, I thought back to how hard I orgasmed that first time â€” and it made me wet. I had been so disgusted with myself that I hadn't masturbated at all since that first notification. I started touching myself again, I almost didn't realize what I was doing at first but by the time it dawned on me my libido had taken over. \n\nThe third time I got the notification the same thing happened. And again, and again. The cycle continued: Get notification. Masturbate and cum. Become disgusted with myself and swear off self-pleasure. Get notification. Masturbate and cum. You get the idea. \n\nDespite my best efforts (or maybe I wasn't resisting as much as I could have/should have â€” I'm not sure) my brain was making a Pavlovian connection between orgasms and my finding out someone near me had been raped.\n\nThat mental connection strong enough that when I eventually tried 'self-pleasure' when there was no notification, my orgasm was harder to reach and noticeably not as strong. \n\n*This is where it becomes a little less of an accident.* \n\nI decided those weaker orgasms weren't even worth it â€” so I wouldn't even allow myself to cum unless I received a sexual assault notification. I would still masturbate â€” but I would only bring myself to the edge of an orgasm before denying myself. If I wanted that orgasmic release, I would have to wait for someone near my to get raped. \n\nSo that's how, in my mind, I started to cheer for rapists. \n\nI'm not a college student anymore but I still live nearby and still receive the public safety notifications. Whenever I get a notification about something other than sexual assault, I can't help but be disappointed. And when I do see those words pop-up on my phone \"**Public Safety Advisory: Sexual Assault Near Campus.**\", you can be sure a smile creeps onto my face and my panties start getting damp (absolutely soaking when it's been a while) â€” I know I'm going to get to cum and it's all thanks to a local rapist.",
