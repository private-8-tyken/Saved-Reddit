  "selftext": "...I gave in on thursday. again.\n\nF/23, sometimes baiter. Often trying to resist it. Thursday, I couldn't anymore. I just needed that again. So I reactivated my tinder account. I've shared my usual approach on here before - matching, meeting at a bar, going from there (usually to a hotel room). \n\nThursday, I wasn't having much luck with that, though. It was later in the afternoon when I started searching and I just wasn't getting many promising matches. I finally matched with one guy whose profile made it really clear he was looking for fun behind someone's back and a willingness to make it worthwhile. That isn't a requirement for me but it tells me a lot about the type of guy. \n\nHe mentioned living in a suburb nearby and being at work but almost done for the day. I said we should get a drink somewhere (full disclosure, I was already a little day drunk). He said why bother with that - his house was empty for the weekend and we could just go there since \"after all, we both know what's up.\"\n\nI have such a weakness for that sort of directness. \n\nI agreed. He said to send him an address and he would order me an uber when he was home. I agreed. I didn't give him my address, I'm not that dumb. I picked a place a few blocks away. I wasn't sure what to wear. Bars are easy, this seemed different. Ultimately, I went with a pretty simple sundress and flats. \n\nI showed up to his place around 8pm. It was a nice house and he opened the door as I walked up. He was in his 50s, greying a little but originally a blondish color anyways. In okay shape. Stepping inside, it was clearly a family home. He had cleaned it a bit but the pictures and things made it clear. \n\nHe was quick to pour me a drink. He asked me if I wanted to be shown around. I don't know why. I said sure. It was a nice house. He skipped one room, just a \"oh, that's Melissa's, she's at college\" and then a look on his face like he wished he hadn't said a name. I just nodded. \n\nThe last room was his bedroom. I expected that. He closed the door after us and his hands were all over me. My glass was empty by then and he put it on a dresser. I froze when he started kissing me and had his hand pushing up my dress. My mind was this mess of \"you slut, you idiot, you're back here again.\" In that moment, I didn't want it. I wanted to be back home. I feel like I left my body a bit then. He either didn't notice or didn't care.\n\nWhen I like \"came back to it\" he had pulled the straps off my shoulders. One of his hands was on my chest and the other was in my panties now. I could feel how hard he was, the angle we were at meant he was pressed against my side with it. He was whispering something in my ear and the way he reacted made me think he had probably said it a few times.\n\n\"fuck it, just kneel\" was what he said then. His hand moving out of my panties and to my shoulder. The push down. Him unzipping. I was tearing up by then. He put a hand on the back of my head and told me to be good, to open wide. I shook my head. He said it again. I shook my head. He said it again. I shook my head. He slapped me. I opened my mouth.\n\nHe wasn't that big, thankfully. He scolded me a few times to keep looking up. My mascara was burning a bit but I kept trying. When I would look down, he yanked at my hair. He finally pulled out of my mouth and starting taking his pants off. I don't know why, I might have just been trying to frustrate him more, but that's when I started scrambling towards the door. I was in the hallway when he got me. He pushed me down, face against the carpet. My dress pushed up. Ripped my panties down.\n\nThere wasn't enough lube. I was dry and all he did was spit a little. It hurt so much. He had one hand flat on the cneter of my back, pushing and the other in my hair yanking my head back a bit. I was sobbing, I know I was trying to beg but the words were a mess. He just kept telling me to shut up, to take it. He finished in me like that. and laid there for a moment.\n\nI eventually asked if I could shower. He said yes. I don't know where he was when I was showering. I stayed in there for a while. When I came out, my dress was gone. I just took a towel and started looking. I found him in the kitchen. I didn't say anything and he just pointed to a bottle of wine. There was an empty glass next to it, I just took the bottle. That got a laugh out of him. \n\nI asked where my dress was. He said it was with my phone, and I would get both back at the end of the night. That triggered a feeling of just being hopeless. Another swig from the bottle and a few deep breaths. I asked if I could at least borrow something to wear. He said yes. The way he said it, I knew what would be next. He led me back upstairs and opened the room. He must have set it out when I was in the shower. Pleated skirt and a cropped top. I froze and started whispering no. He told me that he would make it worthwhile and just to do it. \"Don't make it weird.\" I didn't say anything to that, it just seemed so ridiculous. \n\nI put it on. I tried to just turn my brain off after that. when I say a new low, that's what I mean. everything that happened after I put that outfit on. The name calling and insults. Being bent over and told to hold the bed frame but not to touch the bed, since I \"don't deserve that.\" The hitting. So much hitting. My chest and legs, mostly. \n\nHe finished in my mouth the second time. I don't know if he had planned on it or not. I was just relieved it was over. He said I could stay the night and leave in the morning, I was desperate to get out though. He gave me me clothes back and I changed quickly as he called me the uber. I felt like a zombie when I left. I know he said something about doing it again and I just couldn't respond. I don't know if he meant it or not or if he had any idea what my mindset was. ",
