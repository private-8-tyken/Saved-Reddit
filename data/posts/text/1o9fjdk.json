  "title": "I was brutally raped by my neighbor",
  "selftext": "As a pretty big introvert, I don’t really interact with my neighbors unless necessary. I think I can count on my hand how many times me and this one neighbor talked more than just Hi. 5’10”, pretty normal looking white guy in his 30s maybe. I didn’t even know his name. He would look at me a second too long when I take out the trash or during commute, but I didn’t think much of it. He never tried to follow me, hover over me, or hold uncomfortable conversations.\n\n \n\nFew weekends back, on Friday, I was coming home from work. I had no plan with anyone, and I was just excited to be home and relax. As soon as I opened the apartment door, a man covered my mouth and roughly pushed me inside, closing the door behind him. I thought it might be N, but I saw his face and realized that it was my neighbor. I don’t know why, but being taken at my own place was terrifying. My scream was cut short with his slap on my face. He held me by my hair and said “I’ll hit you harder if you do it again” and I never tried to scream again.\n\n \n\nHe didn’t waste time. He pulled my clothes off, ruining my top and underwear. He groped me and kissed me roughly, calling me a ‘fucking tease’ and saying that I’ve been eyeing him every time. I could feel myself getting wet, especially when he started choking me. He pulled me to the bedroom and stripped me naked and ordered me to suck his cock.\n\n \n\nHe wasn’t huge or anything, but he kept slapping my face and yanking my hair as I sucked him, which made it difficult. When he found that my nipples were getting hard, he said he knew that I wanted this. Or maybe it was because I was using my tongue a lot out of habit. He bent me over my bed and started fucking me from behind, and I really tried, but I couldn’t stop moaning. He called me a whore for creaming while getting raped. I kept pleading ‘please’ and ‘stop’ but honestly I think they sounded like moans. He flipped me over and started pounding me in missionary, kissing me whenever he wasn’t calling me filthy names. He bit my nipples and fucked me like he was trying to break me. I begged him not to cum inside, but it only made him harder. He pounded me over and over until he filled my cunt with his cum.\n\n \n\nI thought he might leave, but that was apparently only wishful thinking. While I laid there, crying, he started going through my dresser and found the toy collection. There's not a lot, but he found a dildo, a vibrator, and two sets of handcuffs. I didn’t even realize what he found until I heard the cuffs. I tried to get up, but he easily overpowered me and cuffed my wrists and ankles to my bed. He then started fucking me deep with the dildo and the vibrator on my clit at the highest setting.\n\n \n\nThe next few hours is kind of a blur. He made me cum over and over, shutting me up by shoving my panties in my mouth. I squirted more than once. It was so painful because he did not care to go easy after I came. The only ‘break’ from this pain was when he used me two more times when he got hard again. He came inside me every time. I was just his toy all night. When he was done, I was nearly passed out on the bed, pussy leaking cum onto the toys stuffed into my holes, moaning softly through my ruined panties. He said we’ll be seeing each other more, uncuffed me, and left my apartment. I think he thought I’d do nothing based on my actions thus far. It was past 2AM.\n\n \n\nI texted N when I gathered enough energy but I was too exhausted to do anything else, so when he came over immediately, he saw me pretty much just the way the rapist left me – dildo in my ass, cum covered vibrator in my cunt.  He offered to help in any way. This time, I did something I have never done throughout seven other rapes; I went to the police. We googled what to do so I didn’t clean up or anything. It felt very gross and embarrassing to talk to cops in my state at the time (N came with me and didn’t look embarrassed at all, bless his heart). Despite that, I felt this strong drive that it had to be reported.\n\n \n\nIt wouldn’t have mattered if the guy took pics and videos, I would have still reported him. I think it’s because it happened at my place by someone that can find me again. All of my other rapes were by strangers at a random locations, but this wasn’t the case. I wasn’t going to let this man actually blackmail me or ruin my life from this rape. Thankfully, because of how clear cut it was, it is moving along quickly from my understanding. The police has been very helpful and considerate (even in this administration!), and I haven’t seen the rapist since that night.\n\n \n\nAll in all, I was lucky enough to not get hurt beyond some bruises. But since my last rape which was almost 9 months ago, I thought maybe I’m past that phase of my life. Maybe people don’t look at me and see the rapeslut that won’t fight back or report them, and just moan and fuck back. I really was starting to think that I was free. This rape was laughing at my face as I orgasmed over and over under my rapist. It told me that this is me, and that I haven’t escaped it just yet. It’s a complicated feeling to accept rape as part of who I am.",
