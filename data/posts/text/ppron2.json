  "selftext": "This story happened to me almost 6 years ago and I feel really gross for enjoying it and I never really understood it until I started reading stuff on this sub.\n\nWhen I was 23 and just graduated from college and I wanted to go on a trip to \"find myself\" and explore. I had an indian best friend and I got really into learning about the hindu temples and different wildlife present in northern India's Kashmir region. With her as my local \"guide\" we ended up planning a trip to backpack around her hometown with a number of stops on our itinerary. When we got to India we made our way to her home town and stayed at her parents house but she quickly got into an argument with her parents because they didn't like the way she was living her life for something. After that, she was sort of uninterested in the backpacking trip and just wanted to go to the city of Delhi and get away from this area. I was really upset because we planned this hike and I did not want to come to India just to be couped up in a city because I had lived in and around Chicago my entire life. She argued with me and told me that it wouldn't be \"safe\" for a white girl without any local knowledge to go backpacking alone in this area. Being a dumb \"idealistic\" young woman raised in America though, I did not listen because everyone I met so far was so nice.\n\nFor the next few days, things went pretty well, I met up with some british guys and ended up hooking up with one of them, but their flight was very soon after this and we parted ways. I got to see a lot of stuff on my itinerary but then the weather started to turn bad and it was pouring rain, which made me upset because I still had 8 days left before my flight home. Unfortuantely, the \"hotel\" I was staying in barely had a functioning roof and my room had gotten really damp and started to get mildewy and I was complaining about it in the cafe when a local guy overheard me. I recognized him from the night before because we were watching a soccer game in a big group. We chatted for a bit when he offered to let me come stay at his apartment that was much nicer than the hotel, he even showed me pictures on his phone.\n\nStupidly, I packed up and hopped on his scooter and I was whisked away. When we got there, everything was normal but I could tell by the way he was looking at me that he expected this to be a hookup and I was fine with giving my body away for a better place to stay anyways lmao(because I am kind of a slut). I went into his shower to clean up and when I came out in a towel he was laying on the bed in just his boxer shorts and I could see his dick making a little tent. I let down my towel and I jumped on his bed and started sucking him off which was weird because I never gave a blowjob to an uncircumsized guy before but it was fun. At some point I grabbed a condom out of my purse and slipped it on him before slowly getting on his dick cowgirl style. It took literally two minutes for him to cum and at that point I kind of thought he was a virgin because he was really inexperienced. We fell asleep and cuddled until the morning when I was woken up by a much bigger guy coming into his apartment that I realized was his cousin. He was kind of shocked to see me in bed with his cousin and started making a bunch of noise and they started arguing in their native language until a crowd of about 10 people were in the doorway. Being naked I quickly ran into the bathroom and cleaned up a bit and got dressed, but when I came out all the guys wanted to talk to me even though most of them barely spoke english. When I got outside I realized that we were in a sort of \"worker village\" for some sort of tool or brick making shop and all the little apartments were just filled with the workers. The weather was still terrible but I tried to just leave the village by walking because I got really uncomfortable but the big guy grabbed my arm and brought me over to a little meeting area and they started trying to talk to me asking me where I was from and what I was doing while the guy that brought me there translated because he spoke the best English.\n\nMY nervousness started to subside when we started eating breakfast but I kept re-iterating that I should get going but they kept telling me no, you can't go anywhere there is flooding blah blah blah so I stayed. Everyone was really bored because of the weather and stuff so they just started kicking the soccer ball around and stuff from under the tarp that kept us dry. The guys kept trying to flirt with me but I was just not really interested and kind of too nervous to respond and I just wanted to get out.\n\nMy bad attitude really pissed the big guy off and eventually he just starts talking all aggressive to the guy who was interpretting and picks me up and literally carries me to his apartment. I am not naive and this was exactly what I was thinking was going to happen and I told myself I was going to fight and stuff. But when this all happened I just kind of accepted it and when he pushed me over to the table and started taking down my jean shorts and panties while I starred into the wall and felt him push my lower back down and slowly move his dick toward me. I managed to grab one of the condoms I had in my purse and sort of got him to put it on but he scooted it to just the tip of his dick. He quickly inserted his cock into me after that and began basically using me like a sex toy until he came and the condom fell inside me. He grabbed a box of tissues and told me to \"clean\" and I fished the condom out of me and wiped the bits of cum that got out of the condom. At this point I was just sort of shocked that this happened but I didn't really feel like I was raped.\n\nI put my clothes back on and go back out to the meeting area and just sort of sit back down and get really quiet like nothing even happened. But it was only about an hour before the big guy must have started bragging about what we did to me and they all started being a lot more handsy with me but no one dragged me off again. That night he dragged me into his apartment with him again and this time he put me on his bed with my face into a pillow and mounted me from behind, this time he didn't even respond when I tried to hand him a condom and he stuck his cock deep into me. This time, he reached around with his other hand to rub my clit and grinded into me deeply. Even though I hated it, my legs felt warm and I started to tremble in pleasure as he continued. At the end of this he just came inside me and my legs were pouring out juices, but I rolled over and fell asleep while I curled up and put some sheets between my legs because it was too dark. When I woke up the next day the weather was better so the guys were out working and I tried to leave the camp but one of the guys stopped me and just said \"no\" so I went to go sit down and wait. At lunch time the guys came back and the big guy I was with last night was kind of annoyed at me for \"messing up his sheets\" and I was informed by the interpreter guy that I was supposed to clean before falling asleep so now he wanted me to clean his sheets. I ended up doing this for him, but by the end of the day my problem got much worse. \n\nThe big guy started calling me \"Ghain\" which means whore in his language and suggested that the other guys should take a turn. Eventually one of them took him up on that offer and brought me over to his apartment to fuck.  I don't really know what came over me because I just went with this, no one had to carry me or drag me this time I just walked into the apartment with him and slowly took off my clothes and giving him a bj before slipping a condom on him and letting him get on top of me. Two more guys came in a little bit later and a similar thing happened with them. Some of these guys were super inexperienced because they came very quickly. I fionally got to shower again and I was kind of disgusted with myself but the \"fun\" was just beginning. \n\nI slept alone that night but by the next morning I guess they had talked it over and the reservations that some of them had with raping me were just gone. Shortly after breakfast the big guy took me to his room once again and I sat on top of him on a chair where we just grinded eachother and this time I even had an orgasm. by the time I wiped myself up and walked out of the room there was already another guy who broiguht me to this area with a bunch of bunk beds where he through me down on a mattress. I laid there for a while and about 7 or 8 guys just came up, came, and left and I was covered in sweat and dirt because they were all messy from working. I only broguht about 10 condoms with me and I quickly ran out and asked the interpreter guy to go get more, but he claimed that the store wouldnt be open for a few days. At least most of these guys were inexperienced with sex so they probably didn't have many diseases that I needed to be worried about. \n\nAfter I ran out of condoms I thought they would slow down but they didn't care at all and I ended up just being a full time unpaid prostitute for these guys until the sun set. I kind of just accepted my situation and I wasn't even mad at these guys and we even started just hanging out when they werent fucking me. \n\nA few days passed and my pussy was swollen, I had finger marks on my ass where guys would hold me, and I felt like a used up whore. Everytime I peed some of their cum came out and my pussy started to itch because of the constant irritation. The bed they had eventually give nto me was also pretty messy and was a proper \"whores bed\" I guess. MY flight home was about 40 hours away and by this time I developed a sort of friendship with a lot of the guys but they still were resistant everytime I tried to leave. I eventually visited the interpreter guy and showed him my ticket and told him I needed to go home and after a lot of arguing and fighting they actually let me leave and he gave me a ride back to the nearest bus station.\n\nI thought about trying to go to the police or something but I was honestly scared I would go there and they would bring me back to those guys so I just continued to the airport where I met back up with my friend a few hours before our flight. At this point, I was kind of just relieved to be out of there and made up a story about how much fun I had. In truth she was kind of relieved to see me because the guys took my phone away for those 7 days and I didn't answer her phone calls or my parents until I got out. I made up a story about how I broke my phone and was in a remote area though. I guess at this point I didn't want to be that girl that was turned into a sex slave for a week and it wouldn't get those guys in trouble anyways because I don't even know where I was exactly.\n\nWhen I finally got home there were some consequences; I had chlamidya and had to get some antibiotics and then I also became a single mom lmao, but I am not really upset about that part now. Everyone just thinks I hooked up with a local guy and misplaced his number so thats that.\n\nThis whole situation has just been constant even when I go on dates with guys now. I have them be really aggressive with me and I just want to be used like that again. I never had any thought like this before. Even when I pleasure myself I just think of being used by those guys to get myself off. Thats why I feel so gross I guess.\n\nI guess I am posting here to get some validation for my feelings or something.",

This time, he reached around with his other hand to rub my clit and grinded into me deeply. Even though I hated it, my legs felt warm and I started to tremble in pleasure as he continued. At the end of this he just came inside me and my legs were pouring out juices, but I rolled over and fell asleep while I curled up and put some sheets between my legs because it was too dark. When I woke up the next day the weather was better so the guys were out working and I tried to leave the camp but one of the guys stopped me and just said &quot;no&quot; so I went to go sit down and wait. At lunch time the guys came back and the big guy I was with last night was kind of annoyed at me for &quot;messing up his sheets&quot; and I was informed by the interpreter guy that I was supposed to clean before falling asleep so now he wanted me to clean his sheets. I ended up doing this for him, but by the end of the day my problem got much worse. </p>\n\n<p>The big guy started calling me &quot;Ghain&quot; which means whore in his language and suggested that the other guys should take a turn. Eventually one of them took him up on that offer and brought me over to his apartment to fuck.  I don&#39;t really know what came over me because I just went with this, no one had to carry me or drag me this time I just walked into the apartment with him and slowly took off my clothes and giving him a bj before slipping a condom on him and letting him get on top of me. Two more guys came in a little bit later and a similar thing happened with them. Some of these guys were super inexperienced because they came very quickly. I fionally got to shower again and I was kind of disgusted with myself but the &quot;fun&quot; was just beginning. </p>\n\n<p>I slept alone that night but by the next morning I guess they had talked it over and the reservations that some of them had with raping me were just gone. Shortly after breakfast the big guy took me to his room once again and I sat on top of him on a chair where we just grinded eachother and this time I even had an orgasm. by the time I wiped myself up and walked out of the room there was already another guy who broiguht me to this area with a bunch of bunk beds where he through me down on a mattress. I laid there for a while and about 7 or 8 guys just came up, came, and left and I was covered in sweat and dirt because they were all messy from working. I only broguht about 10 condoms with me and I quickly ran out and asked the interpreter guy to go get more, but he claimed that the store wouldnt be open for a few days. At least most of these guys were inexperienced with sex so they probably didn&#39;t have many diseases that I needed to be worried about. </p>\n\n<p>After I ran out of condoms I thought they would slow down but they didn&#39;t care at all and I ended up just being a full time unpaid prostitute for these guys until the sun set. I kind of just accepted my situation and I wasn&#39;t even mad at these guys and we even started just hanging out when they werent fucking me. </p>\n\n<p>A few days passed and my pussy was swollen, I had finger marks on my ass where guys would hold me, and I felt like a used up whore. Everytime I peed some of their cum came out and my pussy started to itch because of the constant irritation. The bed they had eventually give nto me was also pretty messy and was a proper &quot;whores bed&quot; I guess. MY flight home was about 40 hours away and by this time I developed a sort of friendship with a lot of the guys but they still were resistant everytime I tried to leave. I eventually visited the interpreter guy and showed him my ticket and told him I needed to go home and after a lot of arguing and fighting they actually let me leave and he gave me a ride back to the nearest bus station.</p>\n\n<p>I thought about trying to go to the police or something but I was honestly scared I would go there and they would bring me back to those guys so I just continued to the airport where I met back up with my friend a few hours before our flight. At this point, I was kind of just relieved to be out of there and made up a story about how much fun I had. In truth she was kind of relieved to see me because the guys took my phone away for those 7 days and I didn&#39;t answer her phone calls or my parents until I got out. I made up a story about how I broke my phone and was in a remote area though. I guess at this point I didn&#39;t want to be that girl that was turned into a sex slave for a week and it wouldn&#39;t get those guys in trouble anyways because I don&#39;t even know where I was exactly.</p>\n\n<p>When I finally got home there were some consequences; I had chlamidya and had to get some antibiotics and then I also became a single mom lmao, but I am not really upset about that part now. Everyone just thinks I hooked up with a local guy and misplaced his number so thats that.</p>\n\n<p>This whole situation has just been constant even when I go on dates with guys now. I have them be really aggressive with me and I just want to be used like that again. I never had any thought like this before. Even when I pleasure myself I just think of being used by those guys to get myself off. Thats why I feel so gross I guess.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I am posting here to get some validation for my feelings or something.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
