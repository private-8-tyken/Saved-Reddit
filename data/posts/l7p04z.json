That we write and explorer together.","selftext":"Imagine a medieval world where high magic and the blessings of the gods were a common everyday occurrence. Mythical races and beasts were as common a sight as the trees. Now imagine that this world suffered a series of terrible and near cataclysmic wars. Fonts of magic sealed or destroyed, gods struck from the heavens, people of mythic ancient races destroyed in acts of fear induced genocide and majestic creatures of dream hunted to extinction. Near two hundred years later and man and creatures of the mundane are all that remain. All the wonders of the past have become no more than ancient stories, camp fire tales and myth. All the maps of the old war are inaccurate, former magnificent kingdoms nothing more than leaning stone, vast plains and ranges turned to mountains while some majestic peaks are nothing more than giant lakes.\n\nThis is the world we inhabit, ruled by man. Magic exist but it is so paltry in power that the most some could hope for is a small spark to light a fire or a flickering light to look around the attic. Stories of Elves, Dwarfs, Faries and other mythical folk and animals start something like “My cousins friend’s, sister’s, uncle met a man who saw…”. While old Kingdoms were shattered, those small villages and hamlets that managed to avoid the wars grew with some becoming new fledgling kingdoms.\n\nBut this world is still dangerous. While many seek out normal lives there are those that seek to adventure and explore these ancient areas where monsters supposedly lurk and magic still wreaks havoc on the battlefields they were cast. All in hopes of finding a piece of lost knowledge, holy or arcane bauble or artifact. Or to just map the new world as it is, finding a trade route free of bandits and magic storms.\n\nBut to adventure in this world alone is a death quest, those wishing to take up the life as an adventurer in the small kingdom this story starts in need to seek out an experienced adventurer, someone who has managed to survive three years exploring.\n\nYou’ve finally worked up the courage and submitted your name to the trade guild that you want to become an adventurer. And you wait till an adventurer that doesn’t have an apprentice or recently lost theirs comes seeking a new one and hope you are picked. Where they will take you under their wing and from the life you know to travel and explore.\n\n---\n\nThis is the brief and limited backstory just to kind of set things, we can flesh out details such as name and all of that together or make it up on the fly as we go. I’m not looking to GM a game but have a more of collaborative story telling. I might start off with use walking into a serene and peaceful wood where you soon introduce it growing darker and cold with the sound of vicious hounds baying.\n\nI don’t plan for either of our characters to be all powerful or to always come out on top, either against the world or against each other. Sometimes the world will win, sometime you will and other I will, occasionally we both will.\n\nNow while I want some sort of story and plot I still want my smut, this smut might be between each other or the denizens of the world. So someone against other characters doing things to their partner with or without their consent probably won’t enjoy this. Also I would like for magic items to be a thing but many of these items don’t do what you would hope or have side effects. For example an amulet of healing waters that causes the wearer to start heavily lactating healing milk. Or a ring of invisibility that only works when you’re naked that randomly cuts out. Things like this, maybe we find ancient spells that require strange and lewd rites to invoke their power. (By the way the ancient world was pretty lewd…)\nLets let our imaginations run wild and dirty but try not to get to overpowered or something from the dark eldritch realms might hunt us for this power and our bodies.\n\n---\n\nIn this, I’m fine with playing either the seasoned adventurer or the fresh recruit but I am leaning toward the seasoned adventurer.\nThis isn’t locked for men, women or other only but I will be playing a woman. I also don’t plan for one of us to always be the dom or sub. We might have our preferences but hard subs or doms won’t work.\nAlso the more open you are with kinks the better, I have very few limits and enjoy most ‘common’ kinks and many of the more taboo ones. But any Limits either yours or mine will always be respected.\n\n---\n\nThis can be done on either **Reddit Mail** (~~NOT REDDIT CHAT~~) or **Discord**.\n\nThis is where I would list my kinks and limits instead I did that obnoxiously large version of the kink list, so I’ll post that here.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/riag3GU.png\n\nI’m sure there are things not on it that I’m into or not into that I didn’t think of.\nAlso I like for roleplay to get dirty, vulger, lewd, which ever word you prefer but when not roleplaying treat me like a human being please I promise to do the same.\n\nSo if you’ve managed to make it through all of this thank you. If you want to talk more then please message me and lets see if we can work something out. Please no one sentence ideas, share your thoughts and ideas. I want a partner to build and inhabit a world with me who wants to explore it and each other. Not someone looking to be lead by the hand or told what, when and how to do it.\n\nAlso if I don’t reply tonight its because its late and I might of fallen asleep but I promise to reply as soon as time allows!\n\nAlso forgive any grammar, punctuation, or spelling errors.
