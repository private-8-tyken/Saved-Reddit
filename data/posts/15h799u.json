So like the title said, I was sex trafficked along with a friend for about 4 months I think. It happened between senior year of hs and freshman year of college when we were 18, and we’re both 23 now. We’ve both been in therapy but it’s still so fucking weird to like say that I was sex trafficked you know? Like it somehow doesn’t seem real or something I guess. I suppose my thought was talking through what happened in a sexual setting might be helpful, and I guess I’ve seen a lot of other women do that on here so why not give it a try?\n\n\nThis all happened in Florida I think, because my friend and I wanted to go on a summer trip together to the beach and this was like the first time our parents like let us go that far alone so it’s kind of fucked this happened in that situation. We had planned to be in Miami for a week and we had this whole thing booked out and it was going to be awesome. We had a room in a hotel that faced the ocean and we were super pumped about it. Being totally honest, we did both have the intention of fucking maybe not a lot of guys on this trip, but more than one, so just kind of making sure everything is on the table with me telling this. We had both bought new bikinis and while not thongs, they were very cheeky and pretty revealing. We also had fake IDs to get into bars but we were never even asked for them so we didn’t even need them.\n\n\nEverything had been going well for the first couple days. We hadn’t hooked up with anyone but there had been a lot of flirting which we liked. On the third day we were there, we met this guys on the beach who seemed really cool and was very attractive and into us and seemed to hit it off. We had intended to get his number but we were at a concert and we got separated from him so we kind of chalked it up to just not working out, but we ended up running into him later at a club. He was being very flirty with us and eventually invited us back to his place and we said yes and left shortly after. I remember being pretty nervous, or maybe nervous isn’t the right word, but something, because I guess it was obvious at this point it would be a threesome which wasn’t something I hadn’t particularly thought about happening and I don’t think she did either. It was also pretty exciting though because this guy was in his early 30s he said so it was super hot getting hit on by an older guys like we were, and when we got back to his place it was a super nice condo that also had a beach view.\n\n\nWe get inside and he asked if we wanted some wine, to which we said yes, and he said that while he went and got it, why didn’t we get comfortable on the couch, so we did. While he was gone we were kind of freaking out (in a good way) about what was happening because it seemed kind of surreal honestly. He came back in and offered us each a glass, and said why don’t we give each other a kiss. Neither of us had ever kissed a girl before, much less each other, but we were eager to please so we started making out. He let us do that for a little bit, and then came over and sat next to my friend and we started kissing him and each other if that makes sense. I don’t really know how long it lasted but at one point he like took her hand and put it on his penis (on the outside of his pants) and she started like rubbing it over his pants I think. A little bit later he told her to take it out, which she did, and started stroking him, and then he told us to get down and give him a blowjob, which we also did. \n\n\nIt was so hot doing that honestly and I was surprised how into it I was. I think she and I were both pretty drunk at this point, and we were wanting to please so we were really going at it. At some point in the middle of it he had us take our dresses off, and since neither of us were wearing bras, we were both on our knees in our panties. He let us blow him a for a bit longer and then suggested we head back to the bedroom, which we did. When we got in there, he told us to strip each other and for me to go down on her while he took his clothes off. I had never really been ordered around during sex before, but like it was so hot in this scenario with like an older guy telling us what to do if that makes sense. It was also like fucking surreal going down on my best friend, but it had to be so hot for him to see and it just felt right in the moment to me too? She like half laid half lead back against the headboard of his bed and I got on my elbows and knees between her legs.\n\n\nI kind of lost track of what he was doing at this point because of what I was doing, but not too much later I felt his finger on my clit and then shortly after that he started fucking me. Things started getting blurry at this point and I was chalking it up to the alcohol, but we basically fucked like rabbits more or less. I know my friend and I were cumming like crazy and he was like totally controlling everyone and was also cumming his brains out which was so fucking hot for us. At some point he came for I think the third time maybe, and I think I like passed out after that or something.\n\n\nI know know that he roofied us, but it wasn’t totally apparent right away because of how foggy it left me. I woke up in a different place being fucked by a different guy and I didn’t see my friend. He noticed me wake up but didn’t really seem to care, and even though I was confused I was so fucked up from being roofied I guess it took like a while before I could freak out. I tried to push him off me but he was way stronger than me but I kept trying which made him hit me. It was honestly like impossible for me to really react to what was happening because it was so far out of expectations it like broke my brain maybe. Any time I would struggle he would hit me basically, and I was pretty bruised by the time he was done. He came inside me and then grabbed me by the hair and pulled me up off the bed and took me out of the room and down a hallway and thew me into another room where my friend also was.\n\n\nWe were both naked and she was pretty beat up too, but we both started crying when we saw each other. We tried to figure out what was going on but neither of us could remember anything after passing out with that guy, and when we tried to open to the door to the room it was locked. We started screaming and after maybe like a half hour a different guy came in and beat the shit out of us and told us to shut the fuck up. I guess that’s really when the gravity hit me and I think hit her too and we knew we were in trouble. This is obviously putting it lightly, but I don’t really know how to express how I felt in that moment.\n\n\nIt’s weird because no one ever told us we were being sex trafficked or whatever, and idk what my expectations were (weird to even say that), but I don’t even know when the realization hit me? I don’t know hot to really describe it better, but for maybe the first few weeks or so, before we were like 100% broken, someone would just come in an grab one or both of us and we’d fuck someone or a group of people. If we struggled or cried or anything we were beaten. Eventually I guess we just started cooperating and things got better in terms of not getting hit. In terms of where they kept us, we had a room where were kept and it had a bathroom with a bathtub and shower. We were kept naked for the first few weeks but when we started to cooperate we were allowed to wear athletic shorts and a t-shirt.\n\n\nHonestly over the 4 months we were there, I have no idea how much sex I had. We are in a lot of porn and a lot of pics were taken of, and I am basically positive we were sold to people as we fucked so many different people. Even though I was there for a while I never really got a feeling of where we were until the end. None of the rooms we were in had windows but I guess they couldn’t have taken us that far so we had to still be in Florida somewhere. It’s fucked to say but I guess my mindset during all of this was just to be good so they didn’t kill us? I don’t know if I really had any long term plan outside of that?\n\n\nThe sex was basically all physical, if that makes sense. I was just so fucked in the head from this I think I was just kind of not even thinking which is weird to say for such a long period of time but I was like a robot or something. I would cum sometimes and like physically it felt good but mentally there was just nothing there if that makes sense? It’s kind of hard to put into words, really. We were used anally, orally, and vaginally to varying degrees of roughness, and I guess I was surprised how quickly I like adapted to it? I never wanted it, but I think being mentally checked out helped?\n\n\nI don’t know if surprised would be the right word, but one thing that kind of does stick out to me is how unnatural the porn would be. I have obviously watched porn before, but never thought much about it. It was just so weird having everything having to be aimed towards the camera if that makes sense? Like it wasn’t just normal sex even though I guess it just looks like that for show maybe? Like obviously I knew porn wasn’t real, but it was just weird. \n\n\nIt was so surreal (I know I Keep using that word) when we were rescued. Idk how it happened but long story short the police showed up. It was humiliating seeing my family again since everyone knew what happened and it’s still fucking embarrassing. We bot had to testify in court but idk if anyone cares about that. She and I are still closer friends than ever, and we have been in therapy ever since but I think it maybe only kind of helps. I don’t know why I wanted to do this but I heard about it through a group meeting we were in and investigated.\n\n\nIn terms of sexuality, I would fucking not want this to happened again ever, and I was terrified of men for like two years after and have only recently gotten back into things. I don’t know what came over me the night before we were kidnapped with being into getting ordered around, but I have not felt a need for that to happen again. I have a boyfriend now and we have very vanilla sex which I love, and honestly I don’t know if I could handle anything different. My friend also has a boyfriend and from what we’ve talked about she feels the same way. Like I said in the beginning, she and I are in therapy and I think it has been helping so that’s good, but we haven’t really brought this up outside of that and I don’t think either of us have any intention of doing that. So thanks for reading, this wash honestly very cathartic to write out, so I hope you liked reading it? Also weird to say.

I would cum sometimes and like physically it felt good but mentally there was just nothing there if that makes sense? It’s kind of hard to put into words, really. We were used anally, orally, and vaginally to varying degrees of roughness, and I guess I was surprised how quickly I like adapted to it? I never wanted it, but I think being mentally checked out helped?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know if surprised would be the right word, but one thing that kind of does stick out to me is how unnatural the porn would be. I have obviously watched porn before, but never thought much about it. It was just so weird having everything having to be aimed towards the camera if that makes sense? Like it wasn’t just normal sex even though I guess it just looks like that for show maybe? Like obviously I knew porn wasn’t real, but it was just weird. </p>\n\n<p>It was so surreal (I know I Keep using that word) when we were rescued. Idk how it happened but long story short the police showed up. It was humiliating seeing my family again since everyone knew what happened and it’s still fucking embarrassing. We bot had to testify in court but idk if anyone cares about that. She and I are still closer friends than ever, and we have been in therapy ever since but I think it maybe only kind of helps. I don’t know why I wanted to do this but I heard about it through a group meeting we were in and investigated.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of sexuality, I would fucking not want this to happened again ever, and I was terrified of men for like two years after and have only recently gotten back into things. I don’t know what came over me the night before we were kidnapped with being into getting ordered around, but I have not felt a need for that to happen again. I have a boyfriend now and we have very vanilla sex which I love, and honestly I don’t know if I could handle anything different. My friend also has a boyfriend and from what we’ve talked about she feels the same way. Like I said in the beginning, she and I are in therapy and I think it has been helping so that’s good, but we haven’t really brought this up outside of that and I don’t think either of us have any intention of doing that. So thanks for reading, this wash honestly very cathartic to write out, so I hope you liked reading it? Also weird to say. So, yeah, DMs/chat/whatever open if interested.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":true,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"6d4648a6-ffe3-11e6-8205-0ec1e0632fc0","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dbdbdb","id":"15h799u","is_robot_indexable":true,"num_duplicates":0,"report_reasons":null,"author":"the_color-blue","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":36,"send_replies":true,"media":null,"contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/Rapekink/comments/15h799u/sex_trafficked/","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/15h799u/sex_trafficked/","subreddit_subscribers":158799,"created_utc":1691076306,"num_crossposts":0,"mod_reports":[],"is_video":false},"raw_comments":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":null,"geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Rapekink","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":null,"geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"Rapekink","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"jun9rig","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":false,"author":"the_color-blue","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1691083751,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_jun964v","score":53,"author_fullname":"t2_gtu314qj1","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"I know it was found somewhere, but I don't know if it was like 100% taken down you know?
