Me and her go a long way back having studied together and we've been best friends ever since. \n\nThe cabin was her husband' family's cabin, a beautiful place in the middle of the slopes at this alpine resort. We had separate bedrooms and bathrooms and everything we could possibly need. I had always thought that my friend had married well, her husband being a fit firefighter and a good dad. I had complemented my friend for her nice find many times. My husband wasn't too bad himself in any way, but still, there was just something about this broad-shouldered man a few years older than the rest of us. Anyways ...\n\nBoth couples had managed to get someone to look after our kids for the weekend, so this would be a long-needed adult only trip. We packed our snowboards and skies, and looked forward to enjoying three nights away from the everyday stress. We arrived late Thursday evening, and spent the night just chilling on the sofa, drinking wine and playing some boardgames. We had a real fun time. \n\nI was the first one to call it a night, but decided to take a shower before bed to rinse of the long drive and be ready for the next day. I entered our bathroom and started to undress. I then noticed a second door, a wooden door with a wooden handle and a tall window in the middle. \"Oh, aren't we lucky\" I thought to my self, \"we got the bathroom with a sauna\". Ways which me and my husband could take advantage of that quickly swept my mind and a rush of blood surged through my body. \n\nI finished undressing, caught a glimpse of my naked body in the mirror and went into the shower. I had just started soaping in my upper body, when I suddenly saw a light turn on inside the sauna. \"How weird\" I thought, and rinsed of the shower glass to have a better look. I immediately saw what the situation was. I could see through the sauna door window that the sauna also had a door leading in to the other bathroom, and someone had just turned on the lights in there. I froze, staring through the windows to see who had entered. My friend and I had seen each other naked many times, on travels, wardrobes and such, so that really wouldn't be a big deal. But it was not her lean figure and long blond hair that appeared on the other side of the sauna. It was the tall, dark-haired figure of my best friend's husband. \n\nHe was facing the other way, and I stood perfectly still as to not draw his attention. The only thing he had to do to see my full body naked was to turn around. The feeling I had in my body was like something I had never felt before. On the one hand I was panicking and was thinking if I should slowly get out of the shower and out of sight. On the other hand though, I felt my body getting warm. This was somehow arousing me. Here I was, fully naked, my tits soaped up and shiney, just meters away and in full view of my friend's hot man. A part of me wanted him to turn around. What was I to do?\n\nI didn't get to make a decision before he caught my attention with his movements again. He started to remove his clothes. \"OMG, he's taking a shower\". My heart raced and the anticipation in my body was noticeably growing. First his white, wollen, tight-fit sweater was removed. Omg, that upper body. Then his grey sweatpants, and then finally his boxers was removed. Still facing the other way, he stretched his body, entered the shower and turned on the water. \n\nI was unconsciously trying to cover my tits with my left arm, but only had partial success. I guess I am what Reddit would call \"Busty petite\" with proportions many had envied me throughout my grown up life, but right now it was causing me difficulties. My soaped up boobs were slippery and kept escaping the pressure of my lower arms. My right hand was serving two purposes. It was both holding the shower head and covering up my pussy. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that this had a ... pleasureble side-effect that I think must have played games with my mind. My normal reaction at this point would have been to flea, get out of the shower and cover up with a towel as soon as humanly possible. In stead, I just stood there, eyes mesmerized by the forbidden view I had, my tits playing games with my arm and hot water teasing my pussy.\n\nNew movements on the other side of the sauna snapped me out of my hazy thoughts. He had now turned 90 degrees so I could see this man in profile. The side of his face, his strong arms, and of course his dick. My friend had drunkenly confessed to me that he had the most perfect cock she had ever had. A bit on the large side, but not unmanageable. I now, even if it was only semi-hard from the washing and soaping, could see that she was not lying. \n\nIt got quite blurry from there and I had to look away for a while. This situation, probably in combination with the glasses of wine, was more than I could handle in any decent way. At some point I must have spred my legs because the water pressure from the shower head was now quickly bringing me closer to the point of no return. My whole body was just on fire, and the risk of him seeing my like this was just to much. My left hand had now left my tits and in stead helped to spread my pussy and expose my clit to the stream of water. I've never had any issues reaching orgasm but this one was especially easy. Water pressure here in the mountains is higher than what we have in the city, and it was working wonders on my pussy. \n\nJust as I was about to reach climax, I looked up at him again. What I saw put fuel on my fire. He was now turned completely towards me, and his blue eyes looked right at me there I stood like a hot, horny mess. He smiled and had this look on his face like \"I caught you\". I came hard and had to put my left hand up and over my mouth not to alert the whole cabin about what was going on. All the while I held eye contact with him and he didn't look away, just stood there, owning my embarrassment. I could see that he had enjoyed the show. His member was now fully erect and ready to go. But in stead of stroking it, he just cooly exited the shower and went out of my sight. \"Fuck, that was the perfect power move\", I thought.\n\nA few minutes later, I was laying in my bed, replaying in my mind what had just happened. My body was both relaxed and tense at the same time. Both satisfied and hungry for more. I tried to run my hand over my pussy. It was just absolutely soaking and the touch struck like lightning through my body again. I had to stop myself from going for a second round. \n\nMy husband was still drinking wine in the living room, so I got the chance to analyze the situation a bit before I fell asleep. There were a lot of questions. Why wasn't I just able to exit that situation before it even evolved? Is my husband going to figure out what was going on while he ignorantly chilled in the livingroom? What was going to happen the next day when I inevitably had to see him again? And who the fuck builds a cabin with showers you can see between?!\n\n--\n\nOk, a bit more detailed and lenghty (no pun) than I expected, but writing this down now a week or so later made it alive again in my mind (and I have to admit body). I'm willing to share more from that weekend if there is any interest. ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜˜","author":"Scandinavyy","author_fullname":"t2_ju4k5p7f","subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","created_utc":1645273274,"is_self":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/sw8vcg/joining_bathrooms_in_mountain_cabin_caught_me_out/","domain":"self.SluttyConfessions","post_hint":null,"is_gallery":false,"over_18":true,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":null,"is_original_content":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"num_comments":15,"score":167,"upvote_ratio":0.99,"media":{"kind":"self","files":[]},"external_link":null,"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","selftext":"So I (F31) had to start this new account because I don't think either my husband (M31) or friends (F32 and M34) would appreciate me sharing what happened last weekend.\n\nMe and my husband got invited by my friend and her husband to join them on a cabin in the mountains some hours away from where we live in Norway.
