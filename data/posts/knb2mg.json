I&#39;ve always heard be wary of someone wielding a knife, unless it&#39;s obvious that they don&#39;t know what they are doing, i.e. holding it out as opposed to keeping it tucked in. It&#39;s a gun that is generally a stupid choice in a fight, as is often taken b/c few are prepared to shoot someone. Many who carry a gun do so for &#39;protection&#39; as they believe wielding a gun will scare someone off, but anyone with any training knows that you rush/seize a gun the moment it is pulled out. Whereas, with a knife always take care as it is very easy to get stabbed and bleed out before you are able to receive proper medical care. </p>\n\n<p>My advice to women is a small can of pepper spray.
