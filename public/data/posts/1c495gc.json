It's been a while since I last posted. This will be a sort of follow up to that post so read that first. [Here is a link.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/18k9crg/they_reduced_me_to_a_stereotype/) The TL;DR is that I went to a party last semester and got raped by three guys who constantly objectified me as a \"goth girl.\" I thought I'd never see them again. Instead, I sought one out.\n\n\n\nIt all started when I was drinking with some friends in a dorm three weeks ago. One of them was THAT friend who went to the party with me. Anyway, eventually the topic turns to guys we've been seeing and THAT friend casually drops a bombshell. She recently hooked up with one of the guys who raped me! If you remember my last post, this was not the guy who took me upstairs or his roommate, but the third guy (I'll call him L from now on).\n\n\n\nI am completely shocked. I've never told her fully what happened that night but I did say they made me feel really uncomfortable. Not only that, but my friend ALSO had a really uncomfortable incident at that party. I could not understand why she would want to fool around with a guy from that house after that, even without all the details. I voiced my surprise and disapproval but did not make it a big deal. It ruined the night for me, though.\n\n\n\nAfter thinking about it for a days, I tracked L down on Instagram. I followed him and he followed back, and eventually he messaged me asking what was up. I asked him if he remembered me, he said he remembered me from the party last fall. He asked if I enjoyed it. I didn't know what to say, nor did I know if he was referring to the party itself or what happened afterwards. So I just said that the beer was really cheap. He responded with a bunch of laughing emojis. I don't know why, but seeing that really bothered me.\n\n\n\nWe chatted for a few days before he invited me out for coffee. I accepted, part of me intending to confront him about it. Instead, I ended up having a nice time. L was interesting, made me laugh, and shared one of my favorite hobbies. We genuinely clicked, which just made me so much more confused. This guy had been so cruel to me, and it was like nothing had ever happened. He was probably not even thinking about it, yet it was constantly on my mind. We had a nice date and kept texting.\n\n\n\nWe had a second date the next week, this time dinner. It went the same as the first, super pleasant, super sweet. Things were more flirty this time, and I could already see where things were headed. After the date, he invited me back to his place. Despite not being able to mention any of my feelings about that night, I absolutely refused to go back to that house. We left things there.\n\n\n\nWe met by chance on campus two days later. It was late, and we went for a walk. L once again mentioned going to his place, I once again vehemently refused. He then offered to come to mine. This I said yes to. I have my own bedroom, and both of my roommates stay in their rooms. I took him back and things proceeded how you would expect.\n\n\n\nI had steeled myself to stop things if they went in a bad direction. But they just... didn't. He didn't rush things. He listened to what I said. He was a very considerate lover (at least until he was inside me, at which point it became all about him. Whatever, that's most guys). He satisfied me completely and made sure I came before caring about himself. After we finished, he took me out to a cafe.\n\n\n\nThe only hiccup was when he complemented my tattoo. When he said how hot it was, I froze up. It reminded me of the last time, in the house. He noticed my discomfort, slowed down and made sure I was alright. I did not tell him why, and we eventually got back into it. Whether by accident or on purpose, he did not mention it again.\n\n\n\nThat was a week ago. We've texted since then and I'll probably see him again. As is becoming the norm, though, I'm just so confused and conflicted. I can't believe this kind, considerate person is the same one from that other night. I remember his hands on my back, entering me while I told him to please stop, tears in my eyes. How do I reconcile that with this sweet guy who cuddled with me and stroked my hair. I just don't get it.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading again. This is a another post that is longer than I meant it to be. This is a weird mix of ranting and looking for advice, I guess. So feel free to leave a comment.
