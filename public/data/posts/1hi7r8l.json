There’s so much to say about this. Every situation is different and unique because every girl is different, their situation is different, some were naturally more sexual than others. And that’s part of the whole process. Understanding their natural personality, figuring out what their personal life is like, figuring out if there’s any physical attraction there between you to, then using this information to figure out your approach. But then again some of them like this girl named Coral who had a sexy ass body was just so damn hot that I would just flirt with her by giving her compliments and making her laugh. Well she always accepted the compliments and her body language told me she was okay if I crossed the line so then I did. My compliments started getting a little sexual. Then we exchanged snapchats. And then the rest was history!!\n\n2. No I didn’t take them out for drinks. 2 ways. We’d normally flirt a bit at work (always subtle because I didn’t want people to see me unprofessionally flirting with girls) then it would lead to sexting, then at work the sexual chemistry was there. Our physical flirting would get intense (example I’d be bending them “helping” them while they sat at their desk while my penis rubbed on their back) and this would leave us to going in my office OR I’d be in my office or car and send erotic videos of me jacking off etc and sexting them to come to me \n\n3.
