But we are a kink one not a self help one and I'm alarmed at how rapidly the community is growing and that people are conflating this space for kink exploration with people that have trauma backgrounds and desires for roleplay and release with something like a survivor support subreddit \n\nThe reason it's separate is because we don't have the resources to adequately moderate a place where people are genuinely looking for help and maybe getting roleplay answers instead \n\nThat's why we stick to the kink theme. I love that you found the place helpful and cathartic and a release but we have a rule in place specifically that this place isn't a vent it's not a replacement for therapy and that people shouldn't pose as therapists to people who are here \n\nHope that makes sense as to why we have these rules. I would hate if someone who was undergoing  some kind of abuse came in here felt it was okay and normalised because of the theme and the comments and then ended up suffering more as a result\n\nWw really want people to be safe and happy and have a release here.
