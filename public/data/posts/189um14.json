There was a group of people in New Zealand that ran a ‘sexring’ and prided themselves on boasting on social media about drugging and having sex with school girls and the dad  of the main guy had a career in television which obviously grabbed the headlines. There was a Facebook page that they ran which became quite popular and guys who would attend parties would have to entertain their dates and stuff if they wanted to be apart of the group. They would then share and gloat about it on Facebook live for the whole world to see and ran an ask.fm for Q&A’s of the most vulgar and disgusting confessions. This has been going for a while until a girl made a report to the police which ended with no charges being laid due to lack of evidence! This got national headlines and protests around the country. Only in 2020 about a decade later of since the initial allegation they reopened the case and arrested 2 guys with one living overseas still. \n\nMy story began when I was living at my grandma’s house when my parents had to leave for a work emergency. My friend Jess who is 2 years older invited me to a non school organized party, few of her friends had sport the next day and she gets one entry with a girl. Me being 14 at the time, had never been to a party like this before. When we got there it was a huge 3 storey house with over 100+ people there, very loud music with tons of drinks, I have had drinks before but in sips. I met this guy named Aaron, he and I started playing beer pong and then later got me a drink in a cup for me and my friend. Suddenly we both were feeling off and our vision distorted and that’s when Aaron took us up to a room and we both just passed out, I don’t remember getting up to the room.  \n\nI woke up to Aaron on top of me, still dazed I screamed and screamed with my voices being unheard by the speakers that were in the room and looking around with the lights on there were 2 other unconscious girls with 3 guys and blood on mine and another bed. That moment of complete shock and freeze dawned upon me and that’s when he took me up hugging me and opened the door to many boys screaming and he was running around screaming with everyone touching me until this guy got my hands behind me and tied them together before Aaron lifted me up to a crowd surf with my hands tied behind my back still, absolutely mortifying with about all the 20 guys just going through me. It was stuff of nightmares and in a complete freeze but I still picture and remember everything happening in slow motion until Aaron came and grabbed me off a guy and took me out and put me in the back and went on an extremely dangerous journey to the park while he took advantage of me and at the park with everyone and the another guy on the way back. \n\nOnce they came back (I don’t know how I lived through that drive) it’s like they were parading me around with the 2 other girls that still hadn’t regained consciousness. And later 2 guys after 2 guys kept going in and out of the room using us and they were begging me to drink more so that they can use me while I was asleep. I woke up the next day on top of a table where the music was with a guy sleeping on my lap. \n\nThat was horrific. That was brutalizing. I would never wish that upon my worst enemy. Ever! The horrifying trauma and embarrassment and humiliation feeling so small that one had to endure takes over life that becomes not worth living. Living to die. To also know the man person is still roaming around somewhere in the world showcases the levels of human ignorance. I am sad, I have wanted to end my life, this is me this is my story and this is how the rest of my life will be defined.\n\nObviously I haven't mentioned much more information but this is what happened overall.
