I have removed them and others that may be reasons for posts to be removed. If this post will be removed again, then it will be so. \n\nDue to the nature of this forum I am aware that it will arouse some and have come to accept it. I also used my abuse experience as forms of arousal to cope during my captivity. English is not my first language so please excuse me for grammatical and spelling mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nMy story of captivity\n\n\nMy mother befriended a woman who turned out to be a snake. She gave us food which turned out to be drugged.\n\nI awoken to be in a room filled with other women. One girl woke me up to ask if I knew what was happening. I didn't know a thing. I went on to try and find my sisters but to no no avail. Girls were crying and welping.  During the commotion, a man suddenly unlocked the door from the room we were locked in, and picks us up 3 each every time. We can hear what sounded like biding. After a few girls were called up, I was then forced to go through the door with two other girls. I ended up being in a stage with spectators at the background. We were then forced to strip and be examined like cattle. Bidding after and bidding, I was finally bought by a man we will call Jaif. \n\nJaif would rape and abuse me for 4 years. I was tied in a small room where the the bed frame was near the toiler and bathing area. Another poor girl, calling her Trishala, was also in captivity with me. I was forced to have sex with him 3 times a day. We were brutally raped, sodomized and forced fellatio. He was a disgusting man, short, ugly, balding and always reeks of sweat, I would always cry every time, but he just seems to enjoy. His wife, calling her Mia, was never seems to be bother, in fact, I think she only married him for the security. His sons were also aggressors, were they would vent out their passion and experiment sexual acts on us. Jaif seemed to only purchase me and Trishala because Mia refuses to sleep with him now. Mia has influence over her sons so he doesn't want to risk it. Plus, he is a very lustful and degenerate man. \n\nMy worst experience there was when Trishala was forced to have anal sex for the first time. The hard skin to skin touching noises and the screaming unfortunately aroused me to the point were I was soaking wet. Abuse was the only thing that I was experiencing now so I most likely adapted to it as a means of coping for my pain. She was tied and forced spread eagle on her stomach. She couldn't even fight back... why did that turn me on... that lasted for 20 minutes. From then on, I started getting soaked only when Trishala was getting raped. I love her, but my ego was lowkey glad that I wasn't the one getting raped. I'm sorry Trishala. \n\nHowever, a window of opportunity arisen when the boiler which happen to be overheated, ended up causing a small house fire.  During the commotion, they attempted to restore the house to natural order, not acknowledging me and Trishala's existence. This was when we made a run for our lives. We went to the police immediately.\n\nDue to the evidence of being and having sexual intercouse with Jaif out of wedlock (obviously, we were fucking captives...), we were accused to be Jaif's mistresses, and wanted his money, but failed so we tried killing his family. Because of our economic and social status, we lost, and had penalties places on us.\n\nTrishala, not standing the pain endured and being branded as promiscuous, decided it wasn't worth living anymore. Because of their influence, I was felt I needed to leave and go into hiding until I left the country. \n\nI too contemplated suicide, but then that just means that the monsters win. I left the country and became an aid worker and now studying for psychology to help victims of abuse and trafficking. They haven't won.","author":"[deleted]","author_fullname":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","subreddit_id":"t5_3ht28","created_utc":1611221169,"is_self":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/l1v492/hostage_for_4_years/","domain":"self.Rapekink","post_hint":null,"is_gallery":false,"over_18":true,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":"unwanted rape","is_original_content":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"num_comments":18,"score":192,"upvote_ratio":0.98,"media":null,"external_link":null,"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Rapekink","selftext":"For some reason my original post was blocked, I believe it's because I sent links related to my story.
