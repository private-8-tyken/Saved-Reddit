You understand that this is an AMA. And I’m only asking, to understand you. Since my questions to you, are what interest me.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with judgment, and imo it’s awesome when someone expresses their judgment of me or others. I think it’s a great time to be alive hahaha I mean, imagine the day when you can’t tell the truth, can’t express a fact or you’re not allowed to make a comment that will hurt someone else’s feelings. It’s almost like you’re not allowing others to have feelings, or that their feelings are so precious that they’re not to be prodded or provoked.\n\nYou’re not precious, are you? You can stand up on your own two feet and back your words, your images, your communication and your relationships. You don’t need to justify yourself. Clearly. But I mean, you’re not threatened or weak enough to think that my judgment or words upon you could actually … control you? I don’t think so.

It’s also not fun. It’s also not interesting. \n\nWhilst you welcome judgement, that isn’t something universal. And based on my experience, it’s actually relatively rare. \n\nI’d invite you consider the opposite view. I experience unsolicited judgement and criticism as violence. \n\nSo I think we can agree that it is unacceptable to be physically violent to others without consent. Right? \n\nSo why would we be emotionally violent without consent or solicitation? \n\nYou’re saying ‘their feelings are so precious that they’re not allowed to be prodded’. But I imagine you wouldn’t say ‘their face are so precious that they’re not allowed to be punched’. \n\nNow you might argue they’re different things. \n\nBut I would say that physical health and mental health are equally important. And you have no right to affect either of those negatively, despite having the power to. \n\nSo your viewpoint that you should be allowed to judge and prod people’s mental health implies a mindset that you feel entitled to affect others mental health’s negatively. \n\nNow, either a, you’re ok with that and we disagree. \nOr B, you don’t agree that mental health is as important as physical health and we disagree Or C, you believe you have the right to act violently to someone’s mental health and I don’t agree. \n\nI’m not interested in discussing about whether I’m precious or not. \n\nI’m saying the way you’re talking to people isn’t kind. And the idea that you feel this is a right you have or should have is worth addressing. \n\nJust because you consent to being spoken to that way, doesn’t mean anyone else does or should. \n\nRemember friend, consent is king.","score":4,"created_utc":1689337589,"permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWIAMA/comments/14zdkqq/i_33m_own_a_free_use_slut_27f_ama/jrxdh5n/","is_submitter":true,"parent_id":"t1_jrxby64","replies":[{"id":"jrxerlx","author":"[deleted]","author_fullname":null,"body":"The way I talk to others isn’t kind? lol this coming from the guy that posts “I own a free use slut” haha followed by “don’t judge me” lol recycling “consent is king” because hurting broken people feeds guilt, and OP doesn’t want to feel guilty.\n\nIt’s just a game he says.
