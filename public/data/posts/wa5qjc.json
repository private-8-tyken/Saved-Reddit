At least not in the sense of actual happiness... It's a long one, because I'm using this place for what I believe it to be for. To confess something Slutty I did and shouldn't have. On to the backstory. \n\nI have a friend that I made over a decade ago. We've seen so many people come and go from each other's lives. I was there for all of the boyfriends, girlfriends and heartbreaks. She was there when I met my wife, and after I left her. I've always been more fortunate financially than she has. I went to work while she went to college and I've made a great career for myself while she has always been more of a free spirit. On occasion, I've given her money when she needs it (this comes up later). Not like it's an always thing, we usually trade off on meals when we go out all that good stuff.  In our entire friendship we had never had a romantic moment, we had discussed that it wasn't a thing between us and I genuinely meant it. I feel like she did too. It was nice having a platonic friend to discuss whatever with. This is the story of how it all ended because of ego. \n\nA few months back we're out to eat and she mentions that honestly she was glad it was my turn to pay because she's also recently got broken up with by her boyfriend and he left her high and dry with the rent and she's kinda screwed this month it's a few hundred. More than I've usually given her, but I just had gotten a sizeable bonus that I had been keeping quiet. I had it to help and I believed if I could do it, I should. I wasn't going to let her know so I just told her I'd need to stop by the house, but I'll grab some bottles and come to hers, we'll drink away today's problems and worry about tomorrow's problems tomorrow. She excitedly agrees and says she has to hit the restroom. Waiter comes while she's away and is asking what we want. She's the one who has the menu downloaded to her phone, but it's unlocked so I can see so I pick it up and order the meats (Korean BBQ ordering for anyone who knows how that works). Before I can set the phone down, I see a notification pop up that says \"YAASSS, that's the only thing he's good for\" I couldn't help my curiosity and tapped on the notification. What popped up was a group chat. A few girls talking about only using men for free meals etc. and above it a picture...No face included, but its definitely her snatching a quick picture from across the table of me with the statement that she'll be fine. She's finessing a meal from one of her guys as they spoke and was ready to \"send him home crying\" ...I was furious. It felt confusing but also embarrassing. Like Why would she say something like that in the first place, but not only that, why would she use me as the fool to show out for her friends. I don't think I ever really thought she meant what she was saying to her friends, but I couldn't let that go. I don't want to stay in the message for too long so I just mark as unread, close the app, put the phone back down and when she gets back I act like nothing happened. We eat and I'm figuring I'm just going to go home, and I'll have some time to think, but as we go to say goodbye she reminds me about the drinks. Again, the anger boils up based on what was said earlier but my mind goes to the worst place, and I say \"You know what, I almost forgot\"  \n\n\nHere's where things get awful. I decide I'm going to inform her of what she's done but I'm going to make a show of it. Later that night I go to hers with the bottles. We start drinking but she notices about 4 or 5 drinks in that I'm quiet, kinda standoffish, and comments as much. So I tell her, I thought I'd do something nice for her, pull the cash out of my pocket and set it on the table. She looks at it, then me and smiles, she's in the middle of saying that she wouldn't normally take this when I cut her off and grab it and say \"but, it would be a shame if you couldn't just send one of your guys home crying\". It took her a second to figure out what I was talking about but when it clicks the first thing she says is \"You went through my messages?!\" not shyly, not ashamed, just incredulous. Felt like she was mad that I had the audacity to catch her. I explained the message popped up while I was trying to order the food, but of course none of that mattered. Honestly it shouldn't have. It was wrong of me to check that message. I knew that, but I also was for sure not about to just let her part in it slide. We get into an argument she's mad but slowly breaking as she's trying to explain that she \"was just saying shit to impress her friends,\" \"It's not like that with me and you,\" \"We're actual friends you're not just trying to sleep with me\". In my anger the first thing I said was \"Well maybe we should be!\" she looks confused and says \"What?\". As calm as she was incredulous and completely done with the situation I say to her \"Would you take this money to end this friendship. I'm just 'one of your guys' so I'll help you out here for the last time, in exchange we take that step then never have to see each other again!\" It was too far. I wanted her to hurt, to feel cheap. Most of all, I was done with the friendship if someone would make me the butt of the joke for what? clout? I don't want that kind of friend. She told me to leave, like I thought she would. I said fine and to keep the alcohol, grabbed a bottle that I wanted and put the cash in my pocket and headed for the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe stopped me and told me she REALLY needed the money. I said too bad. She said she'll do it. This is the point I should have called it off. Could've cut my revenge right there and left the bigger man, but ego got in the way. I wanted to see how far it would be pushed, or I'm just a bastard, or I was still touch starved right after my divorce. Who tf knows at this point? A million things I could have done, but what I did was stride over to her push her against the wall and look down at her to try asserting dominance and in my head try to get her to back down. She withdrew a bit and put her head down at my approach,  smaller than I feel like I've ever remembered her being, possibly just shocked at the approach, or scared at the aspect of what was to happen. Either way when she looked up, she never gave me the chance to back down. She pressed forward and pressed her lips into mine. A bittersweet flavor of melancholy that stained my tastebuds while our tongues maneuvered around each other. It was a kiss like I'd think of from a movie. A motion filled with unspoken words but filled with a passion that wasn't love. It was lust, and a feeling of finality. We both wanted it, we both needed it, but neither of us were willing to backdown from the self imposed consequence we had attached to it. I doubt it's something we'd ever have done in any other circumstances but for this one moment. If it was going to be goodbye, it was going to be one we had wordlessly agreed to enjoy.\n\nI grabbed her shirt by the collar and pulled her into me, running my hands down her body gripping parts of her I had only ever touched as a joke, but now doing so with full intention to ravage her. Letting the soft feeling of her ass fill my hands flooding the space between my fingers. She navigated my belt expertly the sound of the metal buckle breaking the silence between us as she reached in and gripped me running her hand along my length never breaking out lips until I felt her tug down my waistband. Pants and boxers in one go as she lowered herself balancing on the balls of her feet. She looked up, the expression being somewhere between defiance, determination and lost in lust. \"This is what you want then\" she said with her hand already traveling down her own pants as she stroked me. \"Not really, but you gotta earn your place right. Make it worth it.\" She pulled her hand from her pants flipping me off and instinctively I grabbed her wrist. Her fingers were wet. Including the middle finger that she was sticking up to me. Whatever was in the moment, I took her finger into my mouth while looking at her and she took my dick into hers while maintaining eye contact. I could feel that same tongue that was just waltzing with mine swirling around the head of my dick as she took it down her throat. All the stories I had heard of times she had blown someone, listening with a laugh and now I was feeling it as she bobbed back and forth. Her look softened on the first moan that escaped my lips. She seemed to find herself enjoying it more and more closing her eyes and focusing on the task at hand. The moment my hand left gripping her wrist she started back on herself playing with her pussy in her pants. I found myself taking that hand and placing it on her head, running my fingers through her hair, massaging her scalp like I had before in moments of her laying against my leg, watching movies innocently, now controlling the speed of her throat taking me in. I knew what we had talked about the way she enjoyed having her throat fuck. Hell I talked to her the morning after she discovered it. So now pulling her hair back into a ponytail I pressed into her gripping the clump of hair and pushing her into me and fucking her throat, feeling it relax and compress around me as she deep throated me, suppressing her gagging as much as she could until finally I heard that cough of begged for breaths. \n\nShe struggled kind of cutely as she adjusted positions fumbling with her pants, trying to pull them down as she continued to gag on my dick, a sloppy blowjob with saliva dripping down her chin spurring me on. Her pants got caught around her ankles almost making her fall to her knees and to save her from that and partially because I was beginning to lose myself in bruising her esophagus. I pulled her off of me hearing the satisfying \\*pop\\* of my dick leaving the vacuum she had created in her mouth. A long breath, and a bit of a struggle even as if she wanted it back in immediately. I pulled her up by her ponytail and turned her around pushing her to the wall as she spread her legs as much as the pants would allow. I kneeled and arched her back pulling her cheeks apart and exposing her to me. Digging right in and sucking on her clit, while my tongue played with it in my mouth. I could hear her moans begin immediately and the sounds of her gripping the wall. Louder and louder while she grinding her hips against my face as if she was trying to ride my nose. Until she finally let out \"Fuck me already!\"\n\nIt snapped me right out of my thoughts when I popped up, still hard, dick covered in now cold saliva. but soon finding the warm wetness of her pussy. She reached back with one hands spreading herself open for me to enter while one of my hands gripped her other cheek and pulled it away before I pushed in, sliding all the way to the base. We just stood there for a bit, couldn't have been more than a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. Crossing that line that we had never so much as considered until now. I picked up the pace hearing her soft moans. Feeling her hand pull back and run across my head, turning her head to take her lips into mine while the sounds of her ass slapping against me filled the room, and where the sound died down slapping her ass until it glowed with a red print radiating heat onto my tingling hand. I stepped on the middle of her pants letting her pull her legs out easier before pulling out and moving from the wall to her bed pulling out to walk that way but never really breaking touching each other in some way. She was holding my hand, then I was behind her running my finger across her clit and gripping her breast. Then turning her around kissing her. Then her pushing me down onto the bed and facing me as she took me into her pussy. Her hips moving furiously as she gripped my chest riding me from base to tip while looking directly at me. Biting her lip and seemingly struggling to find some shit to talk, but losing it with each stroke. When I felt myself getting close, I rolled her hover onto her back standing on the edge of the bed and slamming my dick into her until watching her breast bounce until she pulled up and dug her nails into my back her pussy clenching tight around me as she whispered that she was cumming more to herself than me. \n\nI lowered us both onto the bed feeling myself getting close in her tight pussy as she gripped tight enough to break skin. I had no time to complain about that when she bit the side of my neck and I felt myself ready to cum. I told her I was and all she could utter was \"Inside. Fuck...Inside!!\". And there wasn't any fight from me as I pushed in as far as I could and felt the wild pulses of filling her completely. Pulse after pulse of pleasure pushing into her until they finally slowed enough for her to come to her senses and let me go so that I could pull myself from her seeing a large trail of white running down towards her ass. I was there to celebrate when she got her IUD (Just an excuse to smoke at the time, but now it was how I know there would be no concerns with stuffing her full. \n\nWe were both panting and sweaty, her whole body was slick. This was the moment I could apologize. Try to find a way back...but I didn't. She looked at me and smirked, \"Worth every penny then?\" it was said with a degree of contempt that instantly struck me to my core. Any touch starvation that I had felt? It was gone now, replaced only with the remaining guilt. I found my pants and slid them on as she covered herself. Taking out the money and slapping it on her TV stand for her bedroom TV \"Guess that takes care of it then\" I said as bitterly as she did. I was still somehow upset, battling the guilt sure, but still mad that it had gone this far, but I didn't know whether I was blaming her or myself in the moment. I didn't say anything else. I just shamefully walked out of that room as she lay there. Tightened my belt and left the apartment getting to my car and riding off. It's been a week since then, neither of us has messaged the other and for all intents and purposes. I think we both intend to leave it exactly as we said. We severed our friendship with that event and I don't see us coming back from it. I did a terribly slutty thing and a shitty person thing as a whole. I don't think this is something that I ever come back from. I'm a horrid person, but honestly it still upsets me that she was ok making a joke of me, but I should've never used that to instead make a joke of our friendship and end a friendship of over a decade because we refused to back down and decided to let ego get us fucked.","author":"NoneHeroes","author_fullname":"t2_qkc8dkci","subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","created_utc":1659002375,"is_self":true,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/wa5qjc/ending_a_friendship/","domain":"self.SluttyConfessions","post_hint":null,"is_gallery":false,"over_18":true,"spoiler":false,"link_flair_text":null,"is_original_content":false,"stickied":false,"locked":false,"edited":false,"num_comments":21,"score":17,"upvote_ratio":0.95,"media":{"kind":"self","files":[]},"external_link":null,"raw_post":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","selftext":"I (30M) ended a friendship of over a decade with my longest friend (32F)\n\nFirst let me start off by saying, there are no heroes in this story and no happy ending.

I went to work while she went to college and I&amp;#39;ve made a great career for myself while she has always been more of a free spirit. On occasion, I&amp;#39;ve given her money when she needs it (this comes up later). Not like it&amp;#39;s an always thing, we usually trade off on meals when we go out all that good stuff.  In our entire friendship we had never had a romantic moment, we had discussed that it wasn&amp;#39;t a thing between us and I genuinely meant it. I feel like she did too. It was nice having a platonic friend to discuss whatever with. This is the story of how it all ended because of ego. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months back we&amp;#39;re out to eat and she mentions that honestly she was glad it was my turn to pay because she&amp;#39;s also recently got broken up with by her boyfriend and he left her high and dry with the rent and she&amp;#39;s kinda screwed this month it&amp;#39;s a few hundred. More than I&amp;#39;ve usually given her, but I just had gotten a sizeable bonus that I had been keeping quiet. I had it to help and I believed if I could do it, I should. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to let her know so I just told her I&amp;#39;d need to stop by the house, but I&amp;#39;ll grab some bottles and come to hers, we&amp;#39;ll drink away today&amp;#39;s problems and worry about tomorrow&amp;#39;s problems tomorrow. She excitedly agrees and says she has to hit the restroom. Waiter comes while she&amp;#39;s away and is asking what we want. She&amp;#39;s the one who has the menu downloaded to her phone, but it&amp;#39;s unlocked so I can see so I pick it up and order the meats (Korean BBQ ordering for anyone who knows how that works). Before I can set the phone down, I see a notification pop up that says &amp;quot;YAASSS, that&amp;#39;s the only thing he&amp;#39;s good for&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t help my curiosity and tapped on the notification. What popped up was a group chat. A few girls talking about only using men for free meals etc. and above it a picture...No face included, but its definitely her snatching a quick picture from across the table of me with the statement that she&amp;#39;ll be fine. She&amp;#39;s finessing a meal from one of her guys as they spoke and was ready to &amp;quot;send him home crying&amp;quot; ...I was furious. It felt confusing but also embarrassing. Like Why would she say something like that in the first place, but not only that, why would she use me as the fool to show out for her friends. I don&amp;#39;t think I ever really thought she meant what she was saying to her friends, but I couldn&amp;#39;t let that go. I don&amp;#39;t want to stay in the message for too long so I just mark as unread, close the app, put the phone back down and when she gets back I act like nothing happened. We eat and I&amp;#39;m figuring I&amp;#39;m just going to go home, and I&amp;#39;ll have some time to think, but as we go to say goodbye she reminds me about the drinks. Again, the anger boils up based on what was said earlier but my mind goes to the worst place, and I say &amp;quot;You know what, I almost forgot&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where things get awful. I decide I&amp;#39;m going to inform her of what she&amp;#39;s done but I&amp;#39;m going to make a show of it. Later that night I go to hers with the bottles. We start drinking but she notices about 4 or 5 drinks in that I&amp;#39;m quiet, kinda standoffish, and comments as much. So I tell her, I thought I&amp;#39;d do something nice for her, pull the cash out of my pocket and set it on the table. She looks at it, then me and smiles, she&amp;#39;s in the middle of saying that she wouldn&amp;#39;t normally take this when I cut her off and grab it and say &amp;quot;but, it would be a shame if you couldn&amp;#39;t just send one of your guys home crying&amp;quot;. It took her a second to figure out what I was talking about but when it clicks the first thing she says is &amp;quot;You went through my messages?!&amp;quot; not shyly, not ashamed, just incredulous. Felt like she was mad that I had the audacity to catch her. I explained the message popped up while I was trying to order the food, but of course none of that mattered. Honestly it shouldn&amp;#39;t have. It was wrong of me to check that message. I knew that, but I also was for sure not about to just let her part in it slide. We get into an argument she&amp;#39;s mad but slowly breaking as she&amp;#39;s trying to explain that she &amp;quot;was just saying shit to impress her friends,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not like that with me and you,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re actual friends you&amp;#39;re not just trying to sleep with me&amp;quot;. In my anger the first thing I said was &amp;quot;Well maybe we should be!&amp;quot; she looks confused and says &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;. As calm as she was incredulous and completely done with the situation I say to her &amp;quot;Would you take this money to end this friendship. I&amp;#39;m just &amp;#39;one of your guys&amp;#39; so I&amp;#39;ll help you out here for the last time, in exchange we take that step then never have to see each other again!&amp;quot; It was too far. I wanted her to hurt, to feel cheap. Most of all, I was done with the friendship if someone would make me the butt of the joke for what? clout? I don&amp;#39;t want that kind of friend. She told me to leave, like I thought she would. I said fine and to keep the alcohol, grabbed a bottle that I wanted and put the cash in my pocket and headed for the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped me and told me she REALLY needed the money. I said too bad. She said she&amp;#39;ll do it. This is the point I should have called it off. Could&amp;#39;ve cut my revenge right there and left the bigger man, but ego got in the way. I wanted to see how far it would be pushed, or I&amp;#39;m just a bastard, or I was still touch starved right after my divorce. Who tf knows at this point? A million things I could have done, but what I did was stride over to her push her against the wall and look down at her to try asserting dominance and in my head try to get her to back down. She withdrew a bit and put her head down at my approach,  smaller than I feel like I&amp;#39;ve ever remembered her being, possibly just shocked at the approach, or scared at the aspect of what was to happen. Either way when she looked up, she never gave me the chance to back down. She pressed forward and pressed her lips into mine. A bittersweet flavor of melancholy that stained my tastebuds while our tongues maneuvered around each other. It was a kiss like I&amp;#39;d think of from a movie. A motion filled with unspoken words but filled with a passion that wasn&amp;#39;t love. It was lust, and a feeling of finality. We both wanted it, we both needed it, but neither of us were willing to backdown from the self imposed consequence we had attached to it. I doubt it&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;d ever have done in any other circumstances but for this one moment. If it was going to be goodbye, it was going to be one we had wordlessly agreed to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grabbed her shirt by the collar and pulled her into me, running my hands down her body gripping parts of her I had only ever touched as a joke, but now doing so with full intention to ravage her. Letting the soft feeling of her ass fill my hands flooding the space between my fingers. She navigated my belt expertly the sound of the metal buckle breaking the silence between us as she reached in and gripped me running her hand along my length never breaking out lips until I felt her tug down my waistband. Pants and boxers in one go as she lowered herself balancing on the balls of her feet. She looked up, the expression being somewhere between defiance, determination and lost in lust. &amp;quot;This is what you want then&amp;quot; she said with her hand already traveling down her own pants as she stroked me. &amp;quot;Not really, but you gotta earn your place right. Make it worth it.&amp;quot; She pulled her hand from her pants flipping me off and instinctively I grabbed her wrist. Her fingers were wet. Including the middle finger that she was sticking up to me. Whatever was in the moment, I took her finger into my mouth while looking at her and she took my dick into hers while maintaining eye contact. I could feel that same tongue that was just waltzing with mine swirling around the head of my dick as she took it down her throat. All the stories I had heard of times she had blown someone, listening with a laugh and now I was feeling it as she bobbed back and forth. Her look softened on the first moan that escaped my lips. She seemed to find herself enjoying it more and more closing her eyes and focusing on the task at hand. The moment my hand left gripping her wrist she started back on herself playing with her pussy in her pants. I found myself taking that hand and placing it on her head, running my fingers through her hair, massaging her scalp like I had before in moments of her laying against my leg, watching movies innocently, now controlling the speed of her throat taking me in. I knew what we had talked about the way she enjoyed having her throat fuck. Hell I talked to her the morning after she discovered it. So now pulling her hair back into a ponytail I pressed into her gripping the clump of hair and pushing her into me and fucking her throat, feeling it relax and compress around me as she deep throated me, suppressing her gagging as much as she could until finally I heard that cough of begged for breaths. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She struggled kind of cutely as she adjusted positions fumbling with her pants, trying to pull them down as she continued to gag on my dick, a sloppy blowjob with saliva dripping down her chin spurring me on. Her pants got caught around her ankles almost making her fall to her knees and to save her from that and partially because I was beginning to lose myself in bruising her esophagus. I pulled her off of me hearing the satisfying *pop* of my dick leaving the vacuum she had created in her mouth. A long breath, and a bit of a struggle even as if she wanted it back in immediately. I pulled her up by her ponytail and turned her around pushing her to the wall as she spread her legs as much as the pants would allow. I kneeled and arched her back pulling her cheeks apart and exposing her to me. Digging right in and sucking on her clit, while my tongue played with it in my mouth. I could hear her moans begin immediately and the sounds of her gripping the wall. Louder and louder while she grinding her hips against my face as if she was trying to ride my nose. Until she finally let out &amp;quot;Fuck me already!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It snapped me right out of my thoughts when I popped up, still hard, dick covered in now cold saliva. but soon finding the warm wetness of her pussy. She reached back with one hands spreading herself open for me to enter while one of my hands gripped her other cheek and pulled it away before I pushed in, sliding all the way to the base. We just stood there for a bit, couldn&amp;#39;t have been more than a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity. Crossing that line that we had never so much as considered until now. I picked up the pace hearing her soft moans. Feeling her hand pull back and run across my head, turning her head to take her lips into mine while the sounds of her ass slapping against me filled the room, and where the sound died down slapping her ass until it glowed with a red print radiating heat onto my tingling hand. I stepped on the middle of her pants letting her pull her legs out easier before pulling out and moving from the wall to her bed pulling out to walk that way but never really breaking touching each other in some way. She was holding my hand, then I was behind her running my finger across her clit and gripping her breast. Then turning her around kissing her. Then her pushing me down onto the bed and facing me as she took me into her pussy. Her hips moving furiously as she gripped my chest riding me from base to tip while looking directly at me. Biting her lip and seemingly struggling to find some shit to talk, but losing it with each stroke. When I felt myself getting close, I rolled her hover onto her back standing on the edge of the bed and slamming my dick into her until watching her breast bounce until she pulled up and dug her nails into my back her pussy clenching tight around me as she whispered that she was cumming more to herself than me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lowered us both onto the bed feeling myself getting close in her tight pussy as she gripped tight enough to break skin. I had no time to complain about that when she bit the side of my neck and I felt myself ready to cum. I told her I was and all she could utter was &amp;quot;Inside. Fuck...Inside!!&amp;quot;. And there wasn&amp;#39;t any fight from me as I pushed in as far as I could and felt the wild pulses of filling her completely. Pulse after pulse of pleasure pushing into her until they finally slowed enough for her to come to her senses and let me go so that I could pull myself from her seeing a large trail of white running down towards her ass. I was there to celebrate when she got her IUD (Just an excuse to smoke at the time, but now it was how I know there would be no concerns with stuffing her full. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were both panting and sweaty, her whole body was slick. This was the moment I could apologize. Try to find a way back...but I didn&amp;#39;t. She looked at me and smirked, &amp;quot;Worth every penny then?&amp;quot; it was said with a degree of contempt that instantly struck me to my core. Any touch starvation that I had felt? It was gone now, replaced only with the remaining guilt. I found my pants and slid them on as she covered herself. Taking out the money and slapping it on her TV stand for her bedroom TV &amp;quot;Guess that takes care of it then&amp;quot; I said as bitterly as she did. I was still somehow upset, battling the guilt sure, but still mad that it had gone this far, but I didn&amp;#39;t know whether I was blaming her or myself in the moment. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything else. I just shamefully walked out of that room as she lay there. Tightened my belt and left the apartment getting to my car and riding off. It&amp;#39;s been a week since then, neither of us has messaged the other and for all intents and purposes. I think we both intend to leave it exactly as we said. We severed our friendship with that event and I don&amp;#39;t see us coming back from it. I did a terribly slutty thing and a shitty person thing as a whole. I don&amp;#39;t think this is something that I ever come back from. I&amp;#39;m a horrid person, but honestly it still upsets me that she was ok making a joke of me, but I should&amp;#39;ve never used that to instead make a joke of our friendship and end a friendship of over a decade because we refused to back down and decided to let ego get us fucked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":true,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"wa5qjc","is_robot_indexable":true,"num_duplicates":0,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NoneHeroes","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":21,"send_replies":true,"media":null,"contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/wa5qjc/ending_a_friendship/","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/wa5qjc/ending_a_friendship/","subreddit_subscribers":2148585,"created_utc":1659002375,"num_crossposts":0,"mod_reports":[],"is_video":false},"raw_comments":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"after":null,"dist":null,"modhash":"","geo_filter":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_33rc6","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"awarders":[],"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","total_awards_received":0,"subreddit":"SluttyConfessions","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"ihz7p7i","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"no_follow":true,"author":"NoneHeroes","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1659007975,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_ihz7ebl","score":4,"author_fullname":"t2_qkc8dkci","removal_reason":null,"approved_by":null,"mod_note":null,"all_awardings":[],"body":"That's definitely a bit more in line with how I feel right now.
