    "selftext": "Sorry this is long. I’ve never told anyone about it and I just want to get it all off my chest \n\nOne of my (girl) friend’s from college invited me to a party at her place. I asked my bf if he wanted to go and he seemed unhappy about the idea of *me* going because some guys I had hooked up with in the past would be there. We got into a fight about it and eventually I told him I was going with or without him\n\nAt the party, I was upset about the fight and looking back, I got a lot drunker than I usually would. I had some conversations with guys where I could tell they were flirting/trying to hook up so I told them I had a bf & that was that. But this one guy, I’ll call him Jack, who I’d been on and off with during college didn’t back off despite knowing that I was taken \n\nLike at one point I went to the bathroom then came back and saw Jack had taken my seat on the sofa and there was no more room. He told me I could sit on his lap instead & tried to take my hand and pull me down. I said no and decided to go upstairs to my friend’s room (the host). At this point the drinks were really hitting me and I felt dizzy + needed to sit pretty badly\n\nSo I told my friend I was gonna rest in her room for a while and then kind of stumbled away up the stairs into her bedroom and shut the door. I was thinking about calling an Uber and heading home when the door opened again and it was Jack \n\nHe was asking if I’m ok and I said I was fine and just calling an Uber. He came to lie next to me and was telling me not to leave so soon. I said again that I have a bf and then he started getting way more sexual than before, asking questions about me and my bf’s sex life, whether he fucks me right, whether my bf is as big as him, etc \n\nAt this point I was slurring my words and really out of it. I think I started to fall asleep at some point while he spoke because the next thing I remember was feeling a weight on top of me then looking up and seeing him on me \n\nI told him to get off and he ignored me and started kissing my neck. His hand went up my shirt and that’s when I realised what a bad situation I was in. I started asking him to stop but he didn’t listen he just started lifting my shirt and telling me how much he missed fucking me & how much of a slut for it I used to be. I was wearing a skirt with a thong so he just had to flip it up and pull the thong aside. He started fingering me while he played with my nipples and I just let it happen. The music was so loud and I know maybe I should’ve tried to scream for help but I honestly would’ve been humiliated if anyone walked in \n\nI kept telling him “don’t” and “please stop” but then after a while he was like “fuck I love when you beg me” like getting off on it, so I just stopped saying anything. He pulled his fingers out of me and took his cock out and rubbed it against my pussy. I remember cringing at how wet I sounded. Then he started fucking me and I just lay there and took it. I felt so used just lying there waiting for him to be done. He finally stopped and went deep and came in me. \n\nAfterwards he pulled out, tugged my clothes back in place and told me it was good to see me again, then left. \n\nI must have passed out asleep because I didn’t wake up til the next morning. When I checked my phone my heart sank bc of the texts/missed calls from my bf. We have each others locations and he saw I still hadn’t left the party \n\nI called the Uber to take me to his place and then I called him when I was in the car. I was crying & couldn’t explain the story properly. He came to meet me when the Uber dropped me off and I told him he was right & I shouldn’t have gone. When we were in his apartment he asked me what happened and I explained the whole thing. He went really quiet and then started asking questions about whether I tried to fight him off, why I drank so much and if I came \n\nI know it wasn’t really my fault but in that moment it definitely felt like it was, or like maybe it wasn’t ‘really’ rape. I told him I didn’t try to fight him because I was too drunk and that I didn’t come but then he just said that even if I didn’t come I must’ve gotten wet enough for him to fuck me \n\nAt this point I was crying really badly and he eventually told me to go shower and clean up & we’d talk about it later. I spent forever in the shower trying to feel clean again and when I got out, I went to his room in my towel\n\nHe was sitting there on his bed and I went to his closet to find a t-shirt or something to wear, then he came up behind me and started kissing my neck. I kind of flinched away because that’s exactly what Jack had done before he raped me, and then my bf pulled me closer to him and tugged my towel off. \n\nI remember I was surprised he wanted to have sex because he had seemed pissed but I still felt too in shock about everything and I told him I didn’t want to. He ignored me and started kissing me properly on the mouth so I couldn’t really speak while he pulled me over to the bed. When he was on top of me I just went into panic mode and started crying again and asking him to get off me. He said no because clearly I need to learn my lesson the hard way and maybe next time I won’t go to parties dressed like a slut after he tells me not to\n\nHe fucked my mouth first, and didn’t stop like he usually does if I seem like I need to come up for air. He just pushed it a little and keep going. After that he spread my legs\n\nI didn’t even beg him to stop while he fucked me. And I felt myself squeezing his dick and getting turned on the longer he did it so I guess  I just felt like I deserved this. I came and he told me he bet I was lying about not having an orgasm when Jack fucked me. And now, idk if it’s because my bf gaslit me into it but when I remember that night with Jack I’m no longer 100% sure that I didn’t come  \n\nHe came in me then pulled out and just me there on the bed. When I calmed down I went to go shower again\n\nThat was all month ago now \n\nEver since that my bf has gotten a lot more demanding sexually. He wouldn’t listen if I said no or stop. Most of the time though even if I didn’t want it at first I would end up moaning while he fucked me or even coming from it. We’d never done anal before because I don’t like it but now he fucks all my holes whenever he wants. It all makes me feel really objectified. Like sometimes we’ll be watching a movie and he’ll just take his cock out of his pants and tell me to suck it \n\nIt’s really confusing. I know I should hate it/leave him and sometimes I do hate it. But a part of me really likes being used like that.  And somehow it makes what happened with Jack not seem so bad. Like weirdly I think if he hadn’t raped me after I would be way more traumatised by it. So that’s why I’m posting here because idk where else I could talk about how I kind of like being raped by my bf \n\n\n\n",
