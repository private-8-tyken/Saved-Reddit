He was in one of my classes at school, we cliqued, and we became fast friends. Which quickly became with benefits cause I can't keep it out of me. I eventually (this is like 2.5 months ago now) may have trauma dumped/yapped/cried at him while crossed on the phone (good times🙃). Well, he turned out to have similar sexual interest, and offered to do CNC with me. I find CNC lame, it's not for everyone, so I was pretty disinterested. \n\nLater that month, I was planning a backpacking trip I was supposed to take with my friends (like late May). Unfortunately, my friends are weak willed cowards, and didn't wanna go on an all girls backpacking trip, so I was resolved to go solo. \n\nWhen suddenly, Jorden slammed me eith his idea after I told him my woes!\n\nHe offered to rape me on the trip!\n\nOkay buckle up we're gonna talk why I love this kink so much. I love it, because I like having the fear in me, the stress, the tight throat and feeling of near sickness. My body may hate it sometimes, but my brain fucking needs that fear. The reason I normally rape bait by flaunting is I need to to get any results, cause most people aren't rapists! (Don't rape people it is fucked tho seriously) but I would prefer to just be fucking taken\n\nSo his idea, was to go to the park with me, and essentially hunt me. Which is just like, crazy hot, right?? I was kinda mad I hadn't thought of it, but quickly agreed. We made a plan to go on the trip separately, I would have my location visble to him (which was pretty inaccurate cause the poor cell reception), and he would have to come find me, and rape me, and I had to wait and worry. \n\nSo imagine me, Gorgeous, Girl Scout, Girlboss me, all packed, 35 pounds of gear on my back, going on my first backpacking trip alone. I was so brave 🥺\n\nAnyway, he got there like an hour after me, but I was off. Admittedly this part to you isn't to interesting, but just imagine you're me, stressing, nervous! I'm seeing shadows move in the corners of my eyes and hearing branches break and turning around like it's Peanut! I was so paranoid, and scared, it was so hot for me. Eventually, I had to put my phone in low power mode and lock it into my bear cannister cause I kept looking at it and it was running out of battery. \n\nI arrived at this park at 10 AM, stop in at the park office to get a few copies of the maps I need, I left a note or two in my car, and I hit the trail by 10:15! My hike was mostly uneventful, I was scared the whole time but nothing actually happened, it was all physcologic. I made camp after making it about 9 miles, and their I had to sit and wait. I have been reading some Dune recently (the movies were cool don't @ me 😎) so I boiled up some freeze dried sesame chicken and rice, sat by a fire and read. \n\nAround 7 PM, I'm confident I made first contact with tonight's predator. I say I'm confident, because I think it was him, walking past me on the trail, and recognizing me and looking at my camp. I think it was hi., because some of his gear looked similar and he had the rite body shape, but I was pretty off trail and the face was covered (but who else would cover there face in that heat?) \n\nCome about 9 PM, and I am letting my fire burnout when I hear a loud snap. In the time before this moment, I thought that I had known fear. I had seen shadows and heard the trees creak, my time sitting quietly by the fire alone made me appreciate how loud the forest was if you cared to listen. But when I heard that snap, I felt the primal fear I loved, and before I could turn around, I had a hand pulling at my hair forcing my into my back.\n\nI'm fall into the ground and as I try and fight him off of him, I have the wind absolutely knocked out of me of as I am hit in the chest by my predator. I do like some violence, so this was in bounds for him, before I could mount much of a defence, he is sitting on top of me, pinning me down with his weight. I struggle, but don't get anywhere, I am shouting and screaming at full volume, but no one can hear me, and that? That?! That turns me on so much!\n\nHe me to take my top off by hitting me until I did as he said, and the pulled my pants and panties down to my ankles (hiking shoes would take 2 mins to take off 😭)  he forced my head into the dirt next to my dwindling fire, and raped me there. Admittedly I wish he has forced some head on me, but I understand his desires to get to the main course. \n\nHe fucked me head down ass up in the dirt for probably 10 minutes, as I feebily and half heartedly fought against him. He hit me alot and choked me, which I loved, and then he came inside of me. He left probably two minutes after that, after he made me thank him, which he had to hit out of me.\n\nI went to bed around 12, and had a long day hiking back, I was very sore. \n\nLove and kisses and sorry I hope the formatting doesn't suck too bad I'm on mobile bye! 🥰",
