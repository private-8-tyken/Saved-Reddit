  "selftext": "I don't know if you've figured it out yet, but the truth is that I have been completely winging it and have no overall plan for March Madness. So, it wasn't until after I posted the thread for this round two that I realized how truly fucked I was.\n\nA bit of background:\n\nIn the past twelve months, I have fucked my downstairs neighbor, my best friend's boyfriend, *my best friend*, one of my former professors, three of my coworkers, my boss, *my boss's daughter*, one of the firm's key clients, and a hundred^† other people. Yes, I may be a bit of a whore. Which is a problem, because as I tried to come up with something outrageous to do to successfully complete this challenge, I realized that being a bit of a whore had severely limited my options in terms of whom I really shouldn't fuck that I hadn't already.\n\nI could try my luck with one of my *current* professors — that would have been extremely stupid — but spring break made the logistics all but impossible. My landlord is a faceless LLC registered in the Cayman Islands, so the only one getting fucked there is the taxman. I'm 500 miles away from family, which would involve a minimum of 16 hours on the road to seduce one of my dad's friends or business partners. Hard pass.\n\nThis meant I had to go down a different path, one where the *really shouldn't* applied not to the *who*, but rather to the *when* and *where*. And so, I started to formulate a plan. Stay with me, because there's some Ocean's Eleven-level stuff coming up.\n\nI mentioned above having hooked up with my boss's daughter. Her name is not Anna, so let's call her that. I met her by chance a few months ago at a frat party — she's a freshman at UCSD — and immediately recognized her from the photos on her dad's desk. So, I did what any of you would have: I got close to her, took her under my wing, and showed her what it's like to *actually* party. All while never letting it slip that I worked... under her father.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Anna and I went out together to this very serious thing at the Old Globe but I spent most of the time teasing and discreetly fingering her. She had to bite down on my shoulder to keep herself from moaning out loud as she orgasmed in the dark theater. The next day, I still sported the clearly defined marks of her teeth and I knew what I was going to do.\n\nAnna's father isn't *technically* my boss. His name is not Jack, so let's call him that. I'm more of a freelancer or an independent contractor — and most of the time I work from home. I do come by the office every so often, but three out of every four times I do, it's because Jack has some excuse to see me.\n\nOn Friday, I spent most of the day texting Jack, pulling his strings to ensure he would summon my presence before the end of the day. Oh, my schedule was impossibly busy, but I wanted to see him too, so I would find a way.\n\nI spent most of the day with Anna, and most of the afternoon with Anna and my downstairs neighbor and frequent partner in crime. His name isn't Daniel, so let's call him that. Daniel and Anna had fucked a few times before — our first threesome happened less than a month after I met Anna at that frat party — so it was no surprise that our chance meeting after lunch stretched to several hours of increasing sexual tension, until I suggested we check in to a hotel.\n\nWhen I took a selfie to send Jack and let him know I was almost done with my prior engagement, his daughter was just out of frame — her lips on my clit, my thighs draped over her shoulders as Daniel slammed into her from behind.\n\nI could still taste Anna's wetness on my lips when I kissed Jack in the hotel bar an hour later. We had drinks while I told him lies about why I hadn't been able to see him in his office instead: a meeting with my dissertation supervisor, some promising research leads. When he noticed the bite marks on my shoulder, I told him the truth, that the hot little slut I had been with the night before had had more than she could handle. As his hand moved up my dress and his fingers found their way to my pussy, I told him that I had got us a room while I waited for him.\n\nWe walked past room 207, where I had left Anna and Daniel, and into room 208.\n\nWe couldn't hear it at first over my own orgasm as Jack went down on me, but soon it was impossible not to notice the symphony of moans, screams, and swears coming from the other side of the paper-thin wall. Jack smirked and made a joke about my choice of hotel.\n\nAt one point, Anna's heaving voice was clearly audible above the sounds of the sex, even if it was not completely recognizable. Jack and I responded by ramping up our own noises and it felt as if we were all feeding off of each other's energy. I called Jack \"daddy\" for the first time ever as he rammed his cock into my pussy from behind and came inside me.\n\nJack couldn't stay — he and his wife had dinner plans. I watched him get dressed as I lay in bed naked. Before he left, I asked if he could leave me some cash to pay for the room.\n\nWhen I returned to room 207, I immediately let my dress fall to the floor at my feet and joined Anna in bed, getting into the 69 position.\n\nI drove Anna home the next morning, and then I circled around the block and parked around the corner before texting Jack. I happened to be in the neighborhood and just *had* to have him in my mouth again.\n\n---\n† This may be an exaggeration for effect, but it's possible it's not.",
