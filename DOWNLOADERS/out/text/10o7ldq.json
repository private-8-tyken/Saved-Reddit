  "selftext": "Myself and my husband have began to dabble in Facefucking as I have been wanting to try it for a while. We have never been into kink before but this is the first time where I have been submissive to him and it's something I am really enjoying learning and practicing. \nI love the process of it and the enjoyment for me comes from serving him, it's been one of the biggest turn ons I've ever had. He gives me multiple orgasms during our sessions and then tells me where he's going to cum and it's amazing.\nThe only thing is, after he cums i end up feeling small, vulnerable and feel like I need reassurance that my husband loves and respects me. It's a strange feeling that I've never had before as we have never done such things. I end up asking him if he still loves me and cares about me in order to get the reassurance but I guess my question is, what kind of aftercare would be good for both me and him after he has fucked my throat?",

Usually I tell her I love her, ask her what she thought of the things I did, and we just chill in some great cuddles.\n\nSometimes we have to change it up however if things got too intense (or if play had to be stopped prematurely due to whatever reason). Then it could be me making tea for her, having her be the small cuddle partner (usually I cuddle small) or even giving her some space if I accidentally stepped over a boundary.\n\nIn general I'd advice for you two to just sit down sometime and discuss what you both need for aftercare, and don't forget to also communicate in the moment if there is stuff that you need",

In my case, both I and my sub usually aftercare with cuddles (as I also need some aftercare after being rough). Usually I tell her I love her, ask her what she thought of the things I did, and we just chill in some great cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have to change it up however if things got too intense (or if play had to be stopped prematurely due to whatever reason). Then it could be me making tea for her, having her be the small cuddle partner (usually I cuddle small) or even giving her some space if I accidentally stepped over a boundary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general I&amp;#39;d advice for you two to just sit down sometime and discuss what you both need for aftercare, and don&amp;#39;t forget to also communicate in the moment if there is stuff that you need&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
