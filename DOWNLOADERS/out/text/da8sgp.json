            "body": "Take a look through my [introduction to butt plugs](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/16/introduction-to-butt-plugs/). It includes tips and beginner plug recommendations.\n\nIn particular, if you want a butt plug kit, I recommend Doc Johnson's [Mood Naughty Trainer Kit](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/doc-johnson-mood-naughty-1-trainer-kit-with-3-butt-plugs?variant=14354423087139#oid=106472_4244_r) or CalExotics' [Silicone Anal Exerciser Kit](https://shevibe.com/silicone-anal-exerciser-kit-with-three-plugs-by-calexotics/#oid=1367_1_r). Pretty much every other butt plug set is either [badly designed](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/) or has [badly spaced increments](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/#the-increments-of-butt-plug-sets).\n\nIf you want to size up to bigger toys, read my [guide to training your ass](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/13/so-you-wanna-get-your-butt-fucked/). I wrote it with anal sex in mind, but the same principles apply to using toys.\n\n> I also like the idea of being able to wear a plug for long periods of time\n\nThen read my [long-term plugging tips](https://squirrelmunk.com/2018/07/27/long-term-plugging-tips/) and my [guide to the best extended wear plugs](https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/09/26/my-ideal-long-term-wear-butt-plug/).\n\n> Additionally, are more bulbous plugs better or more elongated ones?\n\nYou want plugs that are [not too blunt and not too pointy](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/#tapered-not-pointy).\n\n> Also, would it be a good idea to get a vibrating one, or to start with one that doesn't vibrate?\n\nIf you want a beginner sized vibrating plug, my top recommendation is Vedo's [Bump](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/vedo-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug#oid=106472_4244_r), which I reviewed [here](https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/01/07/the-little-vibrating-plug-that-could-review-of-vedos-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug/). It's surprisingly powerful for its price.\n\nThere are other great vibrating plugs, such as Lovense's [Hush](https://www.lovense.com/r/q05h0n) and [Edge](https://www.lovense.com/r/bmapdh), [several b-Vibe plugs](https://shevibe.com/brands/b%252dVibe.html?search_query=&page=1&limit=20&sort=featured&Power%20Source=USB%20Rechargeable#oid=1367_1_r), and We-Vibe's [Vector](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/we-vibe-vector-powerful-vibrating-prostate-massager-with-remote-app-control#oid=106472_4244_r). But they cost more and most are too big for a beginner.\n\nAs for whether to choose a vibrating or non-vibrating plug, I generally recommend starting with a non-vibrating plug. Many people progress past beginner-sized toys fairly quickly, so you might as well not spend more than necessary. Once you get into toys that are ~1.5\" in diameter, I think it's wise to consider higher quality toys, since you won't outgrow them quickly, if ever.\n\n> Or possibly just getting this one\n\n[Buying sex toys from Amazon, Ebay, or Aliexpress is a bad idea.](http://dangerouslilly.com/2014/11/sex-toys-from-amazon-gamble/) They routinely lie in their listings and there's an unacceptably high chance you'll receive [a knockoff made of an unsafe material](http://erikalynae.com/2017/01/15/buying-sex-toys-on-amazon). Best to stick with reputable sex shops.\n\nSince you're new to this, you should also read this [short article on safe sex toy materials](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/21/safe-materials-cheat-sheet/).",

I wrote it with anal sex in mind, but the same principles apply to using toys.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also like the idea of being able to wear a plug for long periods of time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then read my <a href=\"https://squirrelmunk.com/2018/07/27/long-term-plugging-tips/\">long-term plugging tips</a> and my <a href=\"https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/09/26/my-ideal-long-term-wear-butt-plug/\">guide to the best extended wear plugs</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, are more bulbous plugs better or more elongated ones?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You want plugs that are <a href=\"https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/#tapered-not-pointy\">not too blunt and not too pointy</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, would it be a good idea to get a vibrating one, or to start with one that doesn&#39;t vibrate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want a beginner sized vibrating plug, my top recommendation is Vedo&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/vedo-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug#oid=106472_4244_r\">Bump</a>, which I reviewed <a href=\"https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/01/07/the-little-vibrating-plug-that-could-review-of-vedos-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug/\">here</a>. It&#39;s surprisingly powerful for its price.</p>\n\n<p>There are other great vibrating plugs, such as Lovense&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.lovense.com/r/q05h0n\">Hush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lovense.com/r/bmapdh\">Edge</a>, <a href=\"https://shevibe.com/brands/b%252dVibe.html?search_query=&amp;page=1&amp;limit=20&amp;sort=featured&amp;Power%20Source=USB%20Rechargeable#oid=1367_1_r\">several b-Vibe plugs</a>, and We-Vibe&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/we-vibe-vector-powerful-vibrating-prostate-massager-with-remote-app-control#oid=106472_4244_r\">Vector</a>. But they cost more and most are too big for a beginner.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether to choose a vibrating or non-vibrating plug, I generally recommend starting with a non-vibrating plug. Many people progress past beginner-sized toys fairly quickly, so you might as well not spend more than necessary. Once you get into toys that are ~1.5&quot; in diameter, I think it&#39;s wise to consider higher quality toys, since you won&#39;t outgrow them quickly, if ever.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or possibly just getting this one</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dangerouslilly.com/2014/11/sex-toys-from-amazon-gamble/\">Buying sex toys from Amazon, Ebay, or Aliexpress is a bad idea.</a> They routinely lie in their listings and there&#39;s an unacceptably high chance you&#39;ll receive <a href=\"http://erikalynae.com/2017/01/15/buying-sex-toys-on-amazon\">a knockoff made of an unsafe material</a>. Best to stick with reputable sex shops.</p>\n\n<p>Since you&#39;re new to this, you should also read this <a href=\"https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/21/safe-materials-cheat-sheet/\">short article on safe sex toy materials</a>.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "Take a look through my [introduction to butt plugs](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/16/introduction-to-butt-plugs/). It includes tips and beginner plug recommendations.\n\nIn particular, if you want a butt plug kit, I recommend Doc Johnson's [Mood Naughty Trainer Kit](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/doc-johnson-mood-naughty-1-trainer-kit-with-3-butt-plugs?variant=14354423087139#oid=106472_4244_r) or CalExotics' [Silicone Anal Exerciser Kit](https://shevibe.com/silicone-anal-exerciser-kit-with-three-plugs-by-calexotics/#oid=1367_1_r). Pretty much every other butt plug set is either [badly designed](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/) or has [badly spaced increments](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/#the-increments-of-butt-plug-sets).\n\nIf you want to size up to bigger toys, read my [guide to training your ass](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/13/so-you-wanna-get-your-butt-fucked/). I wrote it with anal sex in mind, but the same principles apply to using toys.\n\n> I also like the idea of being able to wear a plug for long periods of time\n\nThen read my [long-term plugging tips](https://squirrelmunk.com/2018/07/27/long-term-plugging-tips/) and my [guide to the best extended wear plugs](https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/09/26/my-ideal-long-term-wear-butt-plug/).\n\n> Additionally, are more bulbous plugs better or more elongated ones?\n\nYou want plugs that are [not too blunt and not too pointy](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/11/26/the-elements-of-good-butt-plug-design/#tapered-not-pointy).\n\n> Also, would it be a good idea to get a vibrating one, or to start with one that doesn't vibrate?\n\nIf you want a beginner sized vibrating plug, my top recommendation is Vedo's [Bump](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/vedo-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug#oid=106472_4244_r), which I reviewed [here](https://squirrelmunk.com/2019/01/07/the-little-vibrating-plug-that-could-review-of-vedos-bump-rechargeable-vibrating-butt-plug/). It's surprisingly powerful for its price.\n\nThere are other great vibrating plugs, such as Lovense's [Hush](https://www.lovense.com/r/q05h0n) and [Edge](https://www.lovense.com/r/bmapdh), [several b-Vibe plugs](https://shevibe.com/brands/b%252dVibe.html?search_query=&page=1&limit=20&sort=featured&Power%20Source=USB%20Rechargeable#oid=1367_1_r), and We-Vibe's [Vector](https://www.peepshowtoys.com/products/we-vibe-vector-powerful-vibrating-prostate-massager-with-remote-app-control#oid=106472_4244_r). But they cost more and most are too big for a beginner.\n\nAs for whether to choose a vibrating or non-vibrating plug, I generally recommend starting with a non-vibrating plug. Many people progress past beginner-sized toys fairly quickly, so you might as well not spend more than necessary.

Best to stick with reputable sex shops.\n\nSince you're new to this, you should also read this [short article on safe sex toy materials](https://squirrelmunk.com/2017/10/21/safe-materials-cheat-sheet/).",
