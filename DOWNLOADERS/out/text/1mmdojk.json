I build for them different structured routines to follow, like daily/weekly schedules that include wakeup/sleep time, certain tasks like house cleaning or different errands, clothing, diet, workout, bills payments, vehicle maintenance, etc.... read books and watch movies/TV shows I instructed, and submitt book/movie report. They have to follow and report. Routines are repetitive and sometimes boring, but its a good way to teach them self discipline and following orders. It is very important that the routines will merge into their everyday life not to interfere with their work/school. You start with simple and small things, and gradually increase your involvement in their life. You praise and give small gesture for compliance, like allowing their favorite snack, and \"punish\" for non compliance, like no night put.",
      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I usually start with non physical interaction, especially with novice, in order to ease them into the lifestyle. I build for them different structured routines to follow, like daily/weekly schedules that include wakeup/sleep time, certain tasks like house cleaning or different errands, clothing, diet, workout, bills payments, vehicle maintenance, etc.... read books and watch movies/TV shows I instructed, and submitt book/movie report. They have to follow and report. Routines are repetitive and sometimes boring, but its a good way to teach them self discipline and following orders. It is very important that the routines will merge into their everyday life not to interfere with their work/school.
