He would follow different alt coins and day trade, I had no idea what he was doing but saw that he was really into it and was making 2-3x his money sometimes as little as a few days. I was in love with him and trusted that he knew what he was doing so I would give him money to trade crypto for me. I gave him 500 EUR and he showed me that he made 2500 in a day using leverage. I didn’t even know what leverage meant at the time. \n\nIn December of 2019 we started hanging around at this art bar, the crowd was very hip and there were people our age or slightly older who were into crypto and blockchain and some of them were making a lot of money. We met this guy who was 30 at a time, he had everything we wanted. A nice car, an awesome apartment in the center, my bf and I are both from a small town so seeing S was something that we aspired to be especially my bf. \n\nFor Christmas he invited us to go to Austria with him and his friends to go skiing, we were happy to oblige since none of us went skiing before. S was very respectful and cordial. During the trip my bf and S kept talking about crypto and what coin was going to pop next while I just enjoyed being away in the mountains. \n\nWhen we got back my bf told me he wanted to ask S for a 100 loan to participate in the next crypto pump 2-5x the money, pay back S and have the rest for us. I got worried and told him that it was risky and what if it doesn’t work out. How are we going to pay back the money. \n\nAfter about a day of arguing I convinced him not to take the 100k but take 50k instead, and he asked me if he could put my apartment that parents left me as collateral on the loan. I immediately didn’t feel comfortable with the idea, but didn’t want back down and kill this for him. What if he was right I asked myself? if I didn’t do this and the coin pumped and we could have made all this money? Would he forgive me for not having his back? \n\nSo I agreed. S gave me a 50k loan and I agreed to put down my apartment as collateral. We were so excited that we were going to be rich that I already started looking at vacation spots we were going to go to when this was over. What happened next changed everything. My bf told me it was gone. We got fucked. He bought the top and there was a rug pull and with leverage we lost everything. \n\nHe recovered about 5k which he threw on another trade and lost that as well. My heart fucking sank and I started having a panic attack. My parents had no idea about any of this, they had given me the apartment as a safety net in case something happened id have a place to live in and god forbid needed the money id have an asset in my name.  \n\n\nLater that week we met with S and told him what happened. He was upset to hear that we lost the money and kept calling my bf an idiot. He told us to sell the apartment and pay him his money or that he was going to transfer the ownership and do it himself since he had an encumbrance on the property. \n\nI was so naive that I even asked him if he could forgive the loan somehow or allow us to find a payment scheme to pay him back. I had a job and could pay him a 1000 month but then I couldn’t pay rent. I just couldn’t have him sell the apartment and have my parents find out what a dumb bitch I was for getting involved in all this. \n\nS agreed to my offer and said that I could live with him, save money on rent and pay him back every month, but even then he wasn’t willing to wait 4 some years to get his money back plus 10% interest per year. My bf just checked out and here I was negotiating my future for the mess he initiated.\n\nI was so fucking pissed at him. He told me he was going to get a job and help me with the payments so that we could pay back the loan in half the time. S told us that there was a way he could help us out and make it easier. Since I was going to be living with him, he could pay a 100 EUR/day in exchange that I sleep with him. I didn’t have to cook or clean unless I wanted to, I just had to be available for him whenever he felt like having me. \n\nI quickly did the math in my had and I would be able to pay him back in 2 years, not have to give up a huge chunk of my paycheck and if my bf contributed even 500 a month we could be out of this mess in maybe a 1.5 year tops. I didn’t protest even though my bf made a scene that he wasn’t down with it I agreed. How bad could it be I thought to myself? To be continued.",
