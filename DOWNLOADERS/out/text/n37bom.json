    "selftext": "Warm greetings to my fellow Redditors. I'm Aparna, 24, working and an independent lady living in Mumbai. About my body, I'm 5ft 4, brunette hair and brown skin, a pretty oval face, beautiful 36C cups, sexy legs and a plump ass that I didn't appreciate back in the day.\n\n**Before I get harassed by people who advise me on why cheating is wrong, I urge you to read my entire post before coming up with your arguments.**\n\nAnyways, let us focus on what happened, shall we?\n\nFor those who don't know about me, I have a boyfriend, sorta. He lives in France (let's call him Francis) and we got acquainted through a client of mine. He found my Instagram reels and commented and flirted with me, but that's another story on its own (although, I'd love to talk about it in another post). We knew each other and started dating openly just before the lockdown started. We've been texting, sexting, facetime, exchanging nudes and doing all that we can to spice up our sex life, even though we are 7000 km apart. Throughout 2020, I genuinely connected with Francis and the more time we spend together, the more I want to be with him. To put it short, I love him and he loves me.\n\nPhew, let's put all that lovey-dovey stuff on the side and get into the meat of the content. This happened last week. Francis and I are face timing and we just talked about what happened during the week. We were also talking about something else, but that's a secret, so keep reading.\n\nAnyway, we already passed our first anniversary and Francis wants to give me a present. At first, I asked for him to be next to me but asked me constantly, so I had to give in. I did a bit of research and ended up on Calvin Klein. There was this beautiful leopard-ish bikini set with a scrunchie. I fell in love with it and we both agreed that it would look good on me and my brown skin. My boyfriend was down to buy it for me and I'm expected to receive it within next week.\n\nFast forward a week later and I'm about to receive my package anytime soon. I received a message, saying that my package has landed in Mumbai and I'll receive it within the next hour or two. I'm excited and waiting for it. I spent the evening with my roommates playing Monopoly and having fun. After a while, they went to sleep, which left me all alone at 11 in the night. It's 12 pm and I still haven't received them. Now, it's 1 am, nope. 1:30 am, still no. After a while, I hear my calling bell ringing and I rushed my way to the door.\n\nI swung my door wide open and saw the 'delivery boy' with my package. I snatch my package from him and said, \"Wait here.\" I quickly close the door and removed every single piece of clothing from my body. I open my package and get a look at my new bikini. With the excitement urging inside me, I got into the bikini and behold, it fits perfectly (ish) on me. I hear the door knocking, so I attended it with my new bikini. I opened the door, did a twirl and showed all of my curves.\n\n>\"Like what you see, Mr Delivery boy?\"  \n\"Shut up, and don't say a word.\"\n\nHe quickly got inside and starts kissing me. Feeling naughty in my new outfit, it urged me to kiss him back. We kissed our way to the living room and he pushed his luggage near the couch. Defining him as a great kisser would be an understatement. We even french kissed as we walk. Reminds me of how good French guys are at kissing. As we walk, we tipped on the luggage and fell on the couch, but that didn't stop us from kissing. He started caressing all parts of my body, my face, my shoulders, my back, my tits, my ass, you name it, he touched it. My hands explored his chest and made my way to his crotch and I can feel him getting hard. I made an eye gesture to him towards my bedroom and we made our way to my bed.\n\nWe kissed our way to my bedroom only to push me on the bed where I'm laying on my stomach. He gets on top of me and slides my new thong aside. I try to speak \"F-\", but my mouth was shut down by the delivery boy. I point my finger to the lube and he got my message. He immediately lubed himself and shoves his cock inside me.\n\nI let out a small moan as he thrusts his cock in and out of me. I can hear his grunts and moans as he kisses my back and ploughs me from behind. I feel extremely horny and love every second of it. I feel the intimacy and passionate love-making instead of rough sex. But, that doesn't mean he isn't rough. He pulled my braids and fucks me harder than before. It feels good to get railed by someone you love and I love it so much. But, he didn't last long as I can hear his big grunts and feel something warm inside me. After he pumped every single rope of cum inside me, he lets go of my braids and I collapse on my bed. My fingers explore my pussy to feel his cum oozing out of me.\n\nThe guy removes all of his clothes and he lies next to me. His hands curl over my hips as he cuddles me. I place my hand on top of his and we cuddle together. After a long silence, he speaks.\n\n>\"That was a kinky way of welcoming me.\"  \n>\"Mhmm...\"  \n>\"Did you imagine it would end up like this when we talked about it on the phone?\"  \n>\"Mhmm...\"  \n>\"I miss you, baby\"  \n>\"I miss you too, babe.\"  \n>\"After a year of waiting, I finally ravaged your brown pussy.\"  \n>\"Uh-huh? Then after a year of waiting, I finally made that big French dick cum inside me.\"  \n>\"You did, babe. I love you.\"  \n>\"I love you too, Francis.\"  \n>\"Should we start dating exclusively, baby?\"  \n>\"That's a conversation we should have tomorrow morning over a coffee. For now, let's just enjoy this moment.\"  \n>\"Mmm........\"\n\nAnd that's my story of how I met my boyfriend...... I'm not even sorry if this post came out too lovey-dovey. It just happened and I feel surrounded by love and I'm about to spend the summer with my boyfriend. Sure, he didn't make me cum, but that's not the point. I love him and want to be close to him. I'm confident in his dick and his skills that he'll make me cum through the rest of the summer.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post. Let me know your thoughts as I'd love to hear them. Be sure to comment below on your thoughts and maybe some writing feedback as those are the two that I need the most, besides Francis, obviously ;)\n\nThanks for reading. I love you all.",
