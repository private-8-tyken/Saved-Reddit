I’m kinda new to this stuff so it’ll be a while till we get to that point but I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on general fetishes that are good for this kind of fetish, anyone’s experiences and whatnot, or any advice in general.\n\nThanks y’all :)\n\nEdit: he wants to me to force it on him through hypnosis :)",
