  "selftext": "My first gang bang happened in 2014. Back then being in a gang bang was a way to get out of debt. It wasn’t about sex but a means to an end. My punishment for bad financial choices. When I started down this path I never imagined I'd do it again or that I’d make enough money to go to school to become a Physician Assistant and then some.\n\nThe first time I was hired to let 8 guys take turns having sex with me in front of a large audience. This happened in relative safety and anonymity at an exclusive high end private sex club in Las Vegas called Club Secret. The club was known among the super wealth as a place to watch real sex featuring girl next door types like me with really hot and hung guys. The sex was real and not the faked porn variety and that is what the club members paid to see. A 20 or 30 something year old be completely consumed and overwhelmed sexually by a group of hung guys right in front of your eyes.\n\nThe sex during my first gang bang at the club varied greatly from an erotic massage and intense orgasms to several guys using me at the same time in the roughest and primal ways possible. In the end I was left tired and wasted but I earned around $75,000 in pay and tips and was debt free. While it may seem like a lot of pay, a lot is asked of performers like me. You must be a combination of smart, friendly and submissive along with a cute girl next door look. It’s made very clear that during the show you will be used sexually to the point of exhaustion. And that’s no exaggeration. (A link to that story is below)\n\nAt the time when I agreed to and completed my first gang bang I thought it was a once and done thing. I paid off my debts and learned my lesson. I made some life and career decisions around the same time and changed my life path. For the next year I barely let myself think about that night. I had a boyfriend, I worked two jobs and decided I wanted to go to school to a Physician Assistant. There were times I would think back to the club and the gang bang with varying thoughts about it but for the most part it was like a dream and didn’t really happen. At times I felt ashamed for selling myself while at others I was greatly turned on by it reliving the experience in my mind.\n\nIt wasn’t until the fall of 2015 that both the opportunity and the motivation to do another gang bang at the club came to fruition. Over the last two years I’ve participated in a total of 11 paid gang bangs. None featured 8 guys again but honestly the outcome is mostly the same. Now here I am 3 years later and I just graduated from school a few weeks ago with not only no school debt but a nest egg. While I don’t make $75,000 for each show like I did for my gang bang virginity, each show after has paid me between $25,000 - $40,000 depending upon tips.\n\nI’m not sure if I will continue as I’ll be starting my medical job soon at a large hospital. I’ve only done one show in the last 6 months and that was a private gang bang at a very wealthy person's house near Philadelphia. Similar to how the Vegas club organized things, each person who wants to attend has to pay an entry fee of about $1,000 to watch plus tips.\n\nSo that’s my story. AMA.

I've learned that yoga and massages the days after really help. It's exhausting so every muscle feels sore plus whatever I feel like internally. Being limber does help but it also means the guys want to bend you in different positions and it's not always comfortable but looks good or whatever. It's sort of like porn where the positions that feel the best aren't what looks best on video.\n\nAs for wounds I've had little things but nothing ever too serious. The most visible wounds are bruises around my arms, wrists, waist or legs. They are from the guys grabbing or holding me down or whatever. Those fade after a week or so. ",

I&#39;ve learned that yoga and massages the days after really help. It&#39;s exhausting so every muscle feels sore plus whatever I feel like internally. Being limber does help but it also means the guys want to bend you in different positions and it&#39;s not always comfortable but looks good or whatever. It&#39;s sort of like porn where the positions that feel the best aren&#39;t what looks best on video.</p>\n\n<p>As for wounds I&#39;ve had little things but nothing ever too serious. The most visible wounds are bruises around my arms, wrists, waist or legs. They are from the guys grabbing or holding me down or whatever. Those fade after a week or so. </p>\n</div>",

They were graphic about it. Very graphic. But I guess I sort of didn't believe them or it was a failure of imagination of what they meant or what it would actually be like physically and emotionally. So no they didn't lie. I've gotten to know several of the club owners and they aren't the lying type. They do care about me and us I've found but they also push everyone to get the most out of us.\n\nThis experience has changed me so much. I'd like to think mostly good. I'm more confident about some things. Sexually more confident for sure. It has changed my financial world and career trajectory. I do question whether I did the right thing and if I'll regret it at some point. There are days I sometimes focus on the negative and that I sold myself.

It seems to me that such a reaction would betray a guy as someone who maybe has slut-shaming tendencies and even jealousy issues. \n\nThat said, even if true, I couldn't recommend being upfront with every potential serious BF about it on that basis. People can change too. Someone who would initially have a terrible reaction may in time come to be the most understanding. It speaks to longer-term elements of character like empathy, curiosity, humility. \n\nIt's definitely not an easy thing, this. I know I'd be crazy aroused hearing that, but I also know that I hail from a relatively small sub-section of men who actively fantasize about exactly this sort of stuff. \n\nGood luck in your future relationships, whatever route you go down :)",

If you've been around on /r/gonewildstories long enough, it's sort of informally attained this legendary status of a great series of posts. \"The Vegas Series.\" That's why I was so excited to see OP post more.

I won't be getting paid that way but we want to get paid for the videos we post of me getting fucked by multiple guys & used. I want to know where to go.",
