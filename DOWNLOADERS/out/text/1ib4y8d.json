He was kinda cool I guess and he was a Dom and all that jazz and well I guess it's not too important this first bit cause it was all kinda consensual for a long while. \n\nI should have probably ghosted him when I found out he was cheating on his girlfriend with me and that I was his 'mistress' so to speak but I didn't because.. well I just couldn't. \n\nWe did a lot of things online; he made me do a lot of watersports stuff and it was kinda hot but the main part of what we did that still lingers with me is something I first brought up.\n\nI asked him to do hypno with me and I didn't realize how much it would effect me. After only a few sessions I pretty much couldn't stop myself from just doing anything he asked; even if I didn't want to. I guess some part of me deep down wanted to though or else the hypno wouldn't have worked. Idk I guess I'm just pretty weak willed overall. \n\nThe hypno was nice when everything was working out good in the relationship; but when I started to try and break up with him he'd always use my hypnotic triggers to break me down and continue talking to him. It wasn't very easy to just ghost him either because at one point he had my full account information to everything I had; my reddit, my discord, even my bank info. I guess I'm lucky he didn't end up doing anything to all that before I changed it all back. \n\nI just remember everytime I'd talk to him either over voice chat or even txt my mind would slowly but slowly just go blank and I'd turn into his obedient little whore and do whatever he told me to do; and well... it's stuck to me even talking about it right now. I could do one of those hypnosis wipes they have online; I even have found one but... i just can't bring myself to really reset the programming he's done to me. I guess a part of me still wants it. No I know a part of me still wants it. In the times he's manage to get back contact with me I've had to have someone else block him for me. I've never been strong enough to get rid of him on my own; even the first time I only wad able to do it cause someone else was guiding me. He just knows me to well and knows all my triggers and it's just not fair how quickly he can turn me from saying no to just begging for him to use me however he wants. It sucks even now I feel his pull on me because of what he did to me I can't get rid of the desire to just give in.\n\nThere are nights I struggle not to try and contact him again; against my better judgement. Sometimes I think maybe I should just find another person to abuse me like he did. I really am craving it so badly. \n\nIt keeps me awake at night sometimes wondering what would have happened if I had ever met him in person; if I had actually moved into his garage as a stowaway little fuck hole like we had talked about and how he'd be able to rape my holes whenever he'd want to and I'd just take it...\n\nIt's even worse cause I just moved to a new city that is like half the distance I was from him before. He's still hundreds of miles away but... it has cut the travel time in half. \n\nI'm in a much better relationship now with a girl I love and am probably gonna marry sometime soon but she has a very low sex drive and even when she is horny she just doesn't get that I need that cerebral play like she's going to ruin my life. She's also not very into CNC or other types of rapeplay due to her own personal trauma; which makes me feel even worse since it's now one of my main kinks since everything happened with that hypnosis guy. \n\nThere are moments where I wish I could just find someone to rape me so I can experience something close to that feeling again; but honestly I'd love to just get taken for like a week or 2 and fucked constantly; I just feel so worthless my own girlfriend never even wants to have sex with me and at this point and due to everything that happened I feel like that's where I draw most of my self esteem from is having someone want to rape me. It's like I'm not even good enough for her to want to do anything to me. I'm just not worth the effort I guess. \n\nIdk, this has probably been longwinded and also not very well structured but it feels good just to vent about it; I only have ever made one other post here but it got deleted by mods and it made me feel really bad cause it's very hard for me to ever open up about this kinda shit so hopefully this stays up; though I understand the mods on this community have to be kind of strict due to the nature of this subreddit I guess.
