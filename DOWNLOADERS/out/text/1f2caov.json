  "title": "Raped in my car for 5 hours",
  "selftext": "I [f29] was 24 and traveling cross country in my car. I was sleeping in the back, made a bed out of folding down the back seats and covering it with sleeping bags and pillows.\n\nI heard the door latch open and at first thought an animal or something had bumped against the car. It was all too fast - my eyes opened, I had that thought, realized the car was moving, then all at once he was on top of me. \n\nI screamed into his hand and he shoved his fingers down my throat in response. He was wearing thick gloves and I thought he would kill me. I kicked and screamed and scratched and he dug his fist further into my mouth until I was choking. With the other hand he gripped the back of my skull by my hair and shook me. \n\nHe told me to shut up, to shut up, but it just made me more scared. Adrenaline surged through me and from the corner of my eye I saw the light reflect off his own eyes behind a ski mask and I reached out fast, clawing. \n\nI felt his skin get hooked and then he was on me again - all of his weight pressing against my body and then my head span - he had punched me in the face and doubled down on my lungs. My mind was completely panicked but with no air to breath I suddenly felt completely trapped, and I froze. \n\nOne hand around my throat, one hand brushing my hair. He shushed me. Tears began stinging my face along the welt forming beside my eye. My head pounded. I didn't want to die. \n\nHe told me he wasn't going to hurt me. He just wanted to feel me. He knew I felt good. I groaned underneath him - It was only then I really understood what was going to happen. I didn't have to fear for my life. He was going to rape me and then he was going to leave. He was wearing a ski mask because I was not only his victim but his witness as well. \n\nIt was an odd and awful sensation - relief that I wasn't fighting for my life anymore. Knowledge that instead I would be raped. \n\nHe raped me and raped me and raped me. He tore open my shirt and groped my chest, sucked my nipples, shook me to make them jiggle while I sobbed. He ran his cock into me over and over and over again. Made me feel as he pulled out and pushed back in again. Asked me how good it felt. Told me I liked it. He ate me out until I was leaking and then shoved his cock inside my pussy as I came so that he could feel my insides squirm around him. He turned me over and raped me while pressing my face into the car seats. He slapped my ass and dug his nails into my cheeks. I had felt him take his gloves off to hold my waist as he slammed into me over and over and over again. He told me to cry for him - he loved it when I cried while cumming on his cock. He made me tell him things about my past while he raped me and told me I was doing God's will by letting it happen.\n\nWhenever he came would pump it deep inside me and then grab my hair and face fuck me until he was hard again. He said he wanted to breed me and that's what I was made for - so cumming inside me was most of what he wanted to do. He would pound up against my cervix and then release there while holding me in place. He said he loved the way I spasmed around him.\n\nAt one point he left - only to come back the moment I began to collect myself. As soon as I shakily sat up, he opened the door again and I wailed, but I couldn't think fast enough to fight again. He was on me and that was that. \n\nAt the end he ate my ass out - I cried and cried and begged him to stop. I didn't think I could bear it. But he raped my ass anyway. Slow and deliberate until he had made a grove inside me with his cock and he could begin to pound more rapidly. My entire body lost itself then. The entire rape had been so long, so much of it was disjointed, but having my ass raped was the most overwhelming thing I'd ever experienced. \n\nI could hear him moan, how much pleasure he was experiencing, he kept saying \"oh god yes\" and then - I couldn't hear any more. I couldn't see. My body was completely opened and I wasn't anything anymore but the holes he had fucked. \n\nWhen he was done with me he took a photo and my underwear and left. It was daylight breaking, and I somehow had pieced together from the front dash clock that the whole ordeal lasted 5 hours. \n\nI lay unmoving, I passed out, the lines of consciousness are blurred. Woke up late afternoon disoriented. I remember my entire body ached and I began to cry, realizing it was all real. \n\nIt's been 4 years and I get off to what happened to me. It was not the first trauma of my life but it was the most violent. Sometimes I try to put it off but then the desire builds up and I end up spending multiple hours remembering how he used me and what he turned me into. I've cum so many times from that, it turns me on knowing that I find enjoyment from his abuse. It turns me on knowing my body reacted so much to what he did back then - I can't help but embrace being a rape slut. I'm very open to talking about this - comments and dms are fine but I won't talk about what country I'm in or where this happened. Thank you for reading and I hope you understand ",
