But I noticed that when I do that a spurt of clear pre-cum comes out, I get less erect(but not soft), I become less excited/horny and I can now last for a very long time. It almost feels like I came but I felt no release. I've tried to just not get that close to the edge but then I can barely stroke. any one have any tips? also any additional tips for lasting longer besides edging and kegels?",

            "body": "Here's one method that works for me: The closer you get, the more relaxed your PC muscles should be. Basically, a few moments before you get to that point where you start to drip, focus all of your attention on relaxing your PC muscles. No twitching, not even the slightest. None. Just focus on that, and continue stroking, get your self more and more aroused. If you keep your PC muscles relaxed, you will get closer and closer to an orgasm that will feel always just out of reach, and completely unachievable. Counterintuitively, it will make your harder than you can imagine, and your erection will last longer than normal. Works for me! Any hint of flexing your PC muscles, even the slightest, stop for a few seconds. Then start back up, and try to get closer and closer. That feeling of being right on the edge is unexplainable, not too much compares. If you do it properly, you have to consciously remember to take a breath every now and then! :p\n\n\nIf you're curious, I frequent a site that teaches things like this (I'm kind of submissive and enjoy orgasm denial). I learned about this method [here](http://www.milovana.com/webteases/showflash.php?id=25754) NSFW",

      "body": "Here's one method that works for me: The closer you get, the more relaxed your PC muscles should be. Basically, a few moments before you get to that point where you start to drip, focus all of your attention on relaxing your PC muscles. No twitching, not even the slightest. None. Just focus on that, and continue stroking, get your self more and more aroused. If you keep your PC muscles relaxed, you will get closer and closer to an orgasm that will feel always just out of reach, and completely unachievable. Counterintuitively, it will make your harder than you can imagine, and your erection will last longer than normal. Works for me! Any hint of flexing your PC muscles, even the slightest, stop for a few seconds. Then start back up, and try to get closer and closer. That feeling of being right on the edge is unexplainable, not too much compares. If you do it properly, you have to consciously remember to take a breath every now and then! :p\n\n\nIf you're curious, I frequent a site that teaches things like this (I'm kind of submissive and enjoy orgasm denial). I learned about this method [here](http://www.milovana.com/webteases/showflash.php?id=25754) NSFW",
