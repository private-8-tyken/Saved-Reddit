Not quite as impressive an increase as it sounds, though, because I have teeny tiny fingers.\n\nThere's guides on stretching exercises for trismus, which is what I used.\n\nThis may be able to widen the jaw a little, and also my jaw hurts less when staying open for dick. But there will be a limit on how much it can help - I still struggle with real dick quite often. At that point it's all about positions and angles. I recommend on her back, head hanging off the end of the bed.\n\nYou might also want to look into jennings gags (make sure it's one that's PVC coated, don't want bare metal). You'd want to be very careful how long it's left in on a wide setting as gonna really hurt the jaw otherwise. But, it can allow for getting a little wider more comfortably - it's so much more comfortable to kind of 'rest' one's jaw into it rather than desperately trying to hold my jaw open with my jaw muscles, and also keeps the teeth out the way. I got one when I found I was utterly unable to use a spider gag or ring gag big enough to allow cock; the problem is that I can only JUST get my mouth open enough for cock, so cannot get it open enough for clearance to get a spider or ring gag in. Jennings gag, you put it in closed *then* open it once inside, to whatever setting can be comfortably reached.\n\nI went from being just about able to suck off an average dick for a bit, to taking a throatfucking from a giant dick (requiring all of the above to be able to). So it is potentially possible to make things far better, but, it's something you have to work with together and probably multiple methods to do so - the small jaw issue isn't going to just magically vanish.\n\nThis all assumes that she is comfortable and happy to do so; I'm assuming you wouldn't have made the post if she didn't want to do this herself. But if you haven't talked to her about it, do, don't just expect her to go ahead with it.",

Your skeleton is only held in place by muscles, tendons, and ligaments which are all flexible and water based, they will change shape gradually over time with practice, pressure, and consistency due to the collagen and elastin in our fascia and the way the matrix responds to pressure. Been doing myofascial work for years and had tons of success with this when clients do the homework. \n\nThis is more about changing the bones alignment though. Not what op is asking which is to actually grow a larger mouth and would be like a 20 year long process of torture essentially to bind the mouth open to force the bones to grow longer. Wouldn't be hot, fun, safe, or sane. There are definitely techniques outside of yoga to help those restricted shoulder clients of yours! Unfortunately it takes awhile and can be kinda painful, but most people really appreciate it. 😉😊 Occasionally the bones are really malformed and can only be improved not realigned, maybe you are talking about those people with childhood deformaties and injuries. But if you weren't they might be able to recover fuller range of motion from a skilled massage therapist with a background in myofascial release and other deep tissue modalities 💆🏼‍♀️💖💝.",

Not quite as impressive an increase as it sounds, though, because I have teeny tiny fingers.\n\nThere's guides on stretching exercises for trismus, which is what I used.\n\nThis may be able to widen the jaw a little, and also my jaw hurts less when staying open for dick.

I recommend on her back, head hanging off the end of the bed.\n\nYou might also want to look into jennings gags (make sure it's one that's PVC coated, don't want bare metal). You'd want to be very careful how long it's left in on a wide setting as gonna really hurt the jaw otherwise. But, it can allow for getting a little wider more comfortably - it's so much more comfortable to kind of 'rest' one's jaw into it rather than desperately trying to hold my jaw open with my jaw muscles, and also keeps the teeth out the way. I got one when I found I was utterly unable to use a spider gag or ring gag big enough to allow cock; the problem is that I can only JUST get my mouth open enough for cock, so cannot get it open enough for clearance to get a spider or ring gag in. Jennings gag, you put it in closed *then* open it once inside, to whatever setting can be comfortably reached.\n\nI went from being just about able to suck off an average dick for a bit, to taking a throatfucking from a giant dick (requiring all of the above to be able to). So it is potentially possible to make things far better, but, it's something you have to work with together and probably multiple methods to do so - the small jaw issue isn't going to just magically vanish.\n\nThis all assumes that she is comfortable and happy to do so; I'm assuming you wouldn't have made the post if she didn't want to do this herself.
