I thought this subreddit would be the best place for this and I relate with a lot of the stuff on here. \n\nThere was a lot of conflict at home when I was younger which I guess you could say led to me having ‘daddy issues’ as I found older men attractive and comforting. I desperately wanted to leave home and when my (now ex) boyfriend came along, i thought I’d found the perfect escape. He was 23 and I was 16. \n\nHe was my first boyfriend and the first person I’d ever had sex with. He knew about my traumatic upbringing and used this to his advantage. He knew that I had a totally warped perception of how I should be treated and he found me to be an easy target. I was still in education when I moved in with him which meant he was supporting me with accommodation and finances. He used this to exercise full control over me. I ended up experiencing 2 long years of rape, abuse and what I can best describe as Stockholm syndrome. \n\nHe appeared normal at first, he even made losing my virginity seem like a romantic experience but as soon as I moved in he changed. He told me how to dress and who I could and couldn’t speak to. He began to do degrading things like have me undress and then he’d feel and inspect my private areas to make sure no one had had sex with me. He knew other men showed a lot of interest in me and he couldn’t handle it. He did a lot of things like this but I didn’t realise, at the time, how wrong it was. I thought it was normal.\n \nHe started raping and beating me on a daily basis. Sometimes I’d be so scared I wouldn’t fight it at all. Other times I’d scream and cry and try to run away from him. But he was big and strong and I’ve always been tiny with a little frame so he would just beat me into submission. He used to like to watch me In pain so he would grip me tighter and thrust into me harder until he could see that I was truly broken. I had to hide so many marks and bruises. He would call me so many names and say so many demeaning things to me. \n\nHe got worse and worse with time but I was totally captivated by him. I thought I loved and needed him and that it was my fault he acted the way he did. I didn’t dare try and leave him. I knew he’d hurt me if I tried anything. He would always give me his own style of twisted after care. He’d watch me shower and kiss my bruises, he’d cuddle me and make me feel safe. It made me feel so many conflicting emotions. My therapist later taught me about Stockholm syndrome which helped me to understand why I felt that way even though I technically wasn’t a victim of kidnap but I knew I couldn’t leave if I wanted to. \n\nHe started going online and showing men pictures of me, the men would give him money to come and watch him have hard violent sex with me. I don’t know if they knew that it was real because they would pleasure themselves in front of me even when I was crying and begging for it to stop. It always made me feel so worthless and humiliated. Looking back I think it was some sort of power trip for my ex when he did it with an audience. \n\nI finally managed to leave the relationship after months and months of trying. I’m still terrified of him. I’d never report him for that reason. But I have had therapy since. I’m 20 years old now and I’m as over it as I’ll ever be. I’m now with someone who takes good care of me. My boyfriend knows about my past to some extent, but not in this much detail. \n\nI don’t think I’ll ever be able to feel comfortable telling him that I’m now aroused by rape. I don’t think he’d understand. I feel terrible about it but when we’re intimate, I wish he would pin me to the bed and force himself on me. When men hit on me in public all I can think about is how much I’d love it if they raped me. I fantasise about it a lot.  \n\nI’m open to questions and opinions but please be gentle as it’s my first time opening up about this. ",

She loved the fact that she had total control over me. Sometimes she would make me do horrible things in front of everyone to show how devoted and obedient I was. She was constantly overstepping my boundaries and then blaming me for it. And somehow I believed her.\n\nAt first I hated it but I slowly became the rabid pain slut she had always wanted. I started to crave the very things I said were off limits.\n\nWhen she was physically violent, it was always accompanied with some random sexual element so she could pass it off as foreplay.

When I was raped I just thought I had been aggressively seduced. I called my girlfriend and told her that I had cheated on her with a guy and now I'm straight. I was my rapist's girlfriend for two months before I tried to kill myself. He dumped me because I was too much work.\n\nWhen I got out of hospital, I was fragile and vulnerable and my now ex-wife spotted this.\n\nHer favourite thing was to go to high class fetish parties and hand me around to all the other guests. She loved the fact that she had total control over me. Sometimes she would make me do horrible things in front of everyone to show how devoted and obedient I was. She was constantly overstepping my boundaries and then blaming me for it. And somehow I believed her.\n\nAt first I hated it but I slowly became the rabid pain slut she had always wanted. I started to crave the very things I said were off limits.\n\nWhen she was physically violent, it was always accompanied with some random sexual element so she could pass it off as foreplay. But mostly she liked the fact that she had total control over me - my body *and* my mind.\n\nLong story short, I'm no longer with her. My current partner knows everything and supports me. We find ways to make it work, and I have a good support network of friends.\n\nTo get to the point - there's no right or wrong way to deal with your trauma. If being held down gets you off, that's totally legit and you shouldn't be ashamed of it.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want ❤️\n\n\n",

What you're experiencing as a survivor is pretty standard, it's all about how you work through the trauma in your own head. There's no right way to do that, and developing this kink doesn't make you less than or lessen what you went through and survived. I wish you all the best ♡",
