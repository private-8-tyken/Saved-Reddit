My erections will usually persist post-sex for a long time, and I've no problem ejaculating as much as five times in 15 minutes..\n\nIn practise this rarely happens.  In practise when I have a partner we'll have sex, and once we're both done we'll stop, cuddle, and sleep.  Every bout isn't an epic endurance marathon because frankly we'd get sore or bored.\n\nBut there are times when post-sex people have decided my cock is dirty, and needs to be given a tongue bath.  I love the fact that this can start mere moments after penetrative sex and I'm capable of ejaculating in her mouth without any issue.\n\nSure there are days when we'll spend the afternoon having constant sex, and she loves the fact that I'm capable.  (Though in all honesty the _volume_ of the ejaculation decreases significantly the second time .. though I've not really understood the process.  Sometimes one orgasm == tons of liquid, the next none at all, it almost seems random.)\n\nSo, how many men are like this?  ",

I find myself most compatible with a lover when we have a wild crazy mad sexual romp from anywhere between 1-3 hours. A man that can fuck for 3 hours, cum and then keep fucking and cuming another several times over the next couple of hours...no drugs required...I'd like to meet him. Cuming a couple of times within an hour I don't believe is uncommon or especially skillful. Women are impressed because it overcomes their disappointment that it was over so fast.",

Because she wasn't done yet. Women know that men are very sensitive about their performance, their size, etc and choose their words carefully. Of the men I've known, if they cum inside of 10-15 minutes, they'll end up saying something like, \"I'm still horny\", or \"Wanna go again?\" or, \"I'm not done with you\". The guys that take their time and make sure I cum 6-8 times in a couple-3 hours before they do are usually done after that...it's a grand finale.

I haven't really gone past round 5 in a few years but I can still orgasm without the cum past the 3 and it takes longer (unless the girl has been doing a lot of keagles or has a spectacularly tight ass. Nothing can make me cum as quick as fucking a girl in the ass, playing with her clit, talking dirty and bringing her to orgasm all at the same time). ",
