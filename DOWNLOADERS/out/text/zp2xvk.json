  "selftext": "Taylor here! So exam week is stressful for everyone, military is no different. Yesterday I made a reddit post that I was open to having a bit of fun to blow off steam and to be blunt...reddit did not disappoint!....for those of you wondering, Julie and I are completely fine, definitely still in love, but being bi...sometimes we just want a little no strings attached fun, so what better week than exam week?\n\nBeing an engineering student as a woman at a mostly male college definitely has its advantages. For one, the women's bathroom in the bottom of Nichols is pretty much deserted late in the evening. When a 3rd classman (sophomore) with a fairly muscular build sent me a handsome little gym selfie asking if I was free for the evening, who was I to say no? \n\nTucker genuinely was attractive to me. When he asked if we could meet up, it really wasn't much to decide. Yes, this needs to happen. I was already in the building studying, so there wasn't any big prep or anything like that. Just me in my winter class uniform of grey wool pants, and black button-down shirt. I told him he could come over if he brought a condom, and to make sure no one saw him come into the women's bathroom (for obvious reasons). I made my way to the spot I'd picked out and found a stall that was pretty immaculate from almost never being used (unlike the nasty Old Barracks bathroom with your piccasso problem).\n\nOnce Tucker told me he was on his way, my pants were around my ankles and I started to lightly tease myself, my anticipation and excitement already evident between my folds. Tucker sent me a message that he was outside the door and I quickly snapped a picture of my fingers thrust inside me with a caption for him to \"please cum here\". That was enough of an invitation for him and moments later the handsome man from my chat earlier was in my stall in a deserted restroom, our first time meeting made even more memorable by the fact that my pants were still around my ankles, my long dress shirt barely giving me any semblance of modesty. \n\nHis lips were on me in a moment. His strong hands cupped my bare bum as his tongue slipped into my parted lips and my hands began to work at his belt, unbuckeling his brass buckle, unzipping them and sliding them to the floor to have him match my stylish, pants around the ankles look.  I began to stroke his semi hard member and I gasped as a finger slipped its way deep inside me in a firm stroke that cupped my nub of nerves against his palm, while his finger found a spot deep inside me, sending waves of pleasure through my core.\n\nKnowing we didn't have a lot of time, I broke our kiss, reluctantly coming down from my building arousal, and asked him if he brought a condom. Slipping one out of his ac bag, forgotten on the floor in the corner, I took it from him and slipped it over his length, giving him a few firm strokes as I did. After a bit of repositioning, with my hands against the stall door, Tucker grasped my hips and teased his length between my legs from behind. I reached between my legs and guided his shaft to my waiting entrance. After a few desperate partial strokes,Tucker buried himself inside me and it took everything not to cry out as he filled me in a firm, full stroke.\n\nWith one hand braced against the stall and the other between my legs, my fingers desperately working circles around my clit, Tucker took me from behind, our rhythm of thrusts building to a steady metronome of claps and gasps and stifled moans as we struggled to stay quiet. I turned around, looking over my shoulder at the man thrusting deep inside me as I rubbed my clit and told him in a desperate moan \"please spank me\". A flash and his firm hand slapped against my bare cheek as he stopped mid thrust, almost against my cervix.\n\nOh...oh yes...oh fuck yes i moan as he resumes thrusting and I beg for another and then a third as a and finds my opposite cheek and then back to the first in quick succession, bringing me desperately close to my release. I beg for Tucker to cum for me as he takes my hip in one hand and reaches up to squeeze my small breast with the other. I gasp as he takes one, two, the firm strokes into me, squeezing my breast and hip in what borders on pain as my inner walls clench down around him in an orgasm that drains his own release deep inside me. \n\nIn a breathless, slightly sweaty moment, I look back at him smiling and ask if he feels better now? We both start laughing and he slips out of me as we both come down from our release.  Tucker slips off the condom, and we both get redressed. I check that the coast is clear and we both head out, going our seperate ways, back to the world of exams.\n\nRumor has it, I have another date set up tonight for after SRC (dinner), so who knows, maybe you guys will get another story tomorrow if he is exciting enough (;",
